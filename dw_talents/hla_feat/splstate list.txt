General principle:

- cleric/druid, mage, fighter/ranger, thief upgrades get separate lists, since they can all multiclass
- kits of the same base type can share
- monks, paladins, sorcerers, bards can't multiclass, so they can just ride on existing ones
- we have no shapeshifter/mage dual-classes, so shapeshifters can share with mage blocks
