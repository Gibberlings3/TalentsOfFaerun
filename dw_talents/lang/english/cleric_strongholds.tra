@61   = ~Firewalker, many in your faith serve destruction and chaos, but I know you to be a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, a servant of light whether you know it or not. I hope that I can rely on that goodness now, in this desperate hour.~
@62   = ~Sonnlinor, your arrival is timely. Chaos and destruction are rising in our city - if they are not quelled, it will bring ruin on elf and dwarf and man alike.~

@64   = ~Lorekeeper, your arrival is timely. Athkatla has long been a center of learning - yet chaos and destruction threatens it, to the ruin of your faith and mine.~
@65   = ~Silverstar, your arrival is timely. Our faiths recognise a common enemy - the servants of those gods who in turn serve only chaos and ruin. They have grown bold, and the hour of their fury is at hand.~
@66   = ~<CHARNAME>, your arrival is timely. Your faith has long opposed the Gods of Fury, knowing well the ruin they bring to beautiful things. Tonight, we we share your goddess's anger; tonight, we stand together.~
@67   = ~<CHARNAME>, your arrival is timely. Though you serve the Lord of Battle, always you have sought out worthy and noble conflict. You have another chance to do so this night.~
@68   = ~<CHARNAME>, your arrival is timely. Long have our faiths worked together against the rise of evil and chaos. Tonight we will do so again.~
@69   = ~<CHARNAME>, your arrival is timely. Our faiths have often been aligned, and we must have your aid in this desperate hour.~
@70   = ~It is this task that I ask of you, <CHARNAME>. It is a request I hoped I would never make, but it seems our two temples are destined to collide. The unfortunate thing is that the Talassans will delight in the destruction whether they win or not.~

@72   = ~The Art, and those who wield it, are more than a match for brute power.~

@88   = ~<CHARNAME>, truly you are a servant of your god. A more righteous battle there has not been in Athkatla for long years.~
@89   = ~Feywarden, thank you for your aid. A great evil has been vanquished, and Athkatla will know a measure of peace.~
@90   = ~Indeed not. I am glad you have served the goal of your faith and relieved their suffering, <CHARNAME>.~
@91   = ~And it burned for justice! Truly, <CHARNAME>, you embody the most noble impulses of your faith.~
@92   = ~You speak the truth, I fear. Our faith did not seek this conflict, but we have ended it - with your help, Sonnlinor.~
@93   = ~Nor is it the way of the Morninglord. But it is over now.~
@94   = ~There is wisdom in your words... but I fear there was no choice. And there can be understanding even in sorrow.~
@95   = ~So do I. But if the night is dark, still joy may come in the morning.~
@96   = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>. But sometimes ugliness like this must be endured for true beauty to be possible. On this, your faith and mine are one.~
@97   = ~A sad day, rather, in the eyes of the Morninglord... but I shall not begrudge you your triumph, <CHARNAME>, for we could not have prevailed without your aid.~
@98   = ~Indeed we have, my friend. And though I would have preferred a peaceful resolution, still, tonight's events will send a message to others in the city: justice will prevail.~
@99   = ~Indeed. I am sorry so much blood has been spilled, but at least the conflict has ended.~
@100  = ~You are welcome to enjoy the safety of the temple whenever you wish - we see you as a true servant of Lathander, no matter your own faith. Farewell.~
@101  = ~Thank you for coming, <CHARNAME>. Once again we need you help to maintain order - and I trust you understand that without order and the peace that it brings, there can be no lasting knowledge. Our faiths have a common interest here.~
@102  = ~Thank you for coming, <CHARNAME>. Once again we need you help to maintain order - and I am sure you realize that the mages of Amn rely on that order to pursue their studies in peace. Our faiths have a common interest here~
@103  = ~<CHARNAME>... I had feared you would not come. But although the order that your god seeks is steeped in blood, it is order nonetheless. And this day, it is chaos and misrule that I fear, not tyranny. I promise you that our interests run together in this.~
@104  = ~<CHARNAME>. Though your faith honors the warrior, still I know you understand the need for order, and for battle only for a legal cause.~
@105  = ~Firewalker. Though many in your faith serve destruction and chaos, I know you understand that the hottest flame burns for the clearest cause - that of justice and order.~
@106  = ~Sonnlinor. Once again I must call upon the alliance between our faiths. A conflict is brewing in Athkatla - a conflict which will hurt all our citizens, elf and man and dwarf.~
@107  = ~<CHARNAME>. I admit, I am wary of your faith. But these are desperate times, and you aided the cause of Helm once before.~
@108  = ~<CHARNAME>. Our faiths have oft-times been at odds... but still, we share a common goal today, the maintenance of order and justice in Athkatla.~
@109  = ~<CHARNAME>. It is good that you have come - your faith has always defended nobility and honor, and I am sure that you will see the justice and honor of our cause tonight.~
@110  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for coming - unfortunately, there is a matter that concerns both our faiths, and which requires immediate attention~
@111  = ~It is ignorance that leads to tragedies like this. If the Talassans had truly understood their situation, they would not have thrown their lives away. Their comrades have gained knowledge today, but at a bitter price.~
@112  = ~Open warfare would have brought ruin to all of Athkatla, the students of the Art not least. I served Azuth's will this day; he would not want the wizards of the city drawn into pointless conflict.~
@113  = ~It sits ill with me to parley with the Lathanderites, but my Lord's goals will not be solved by unfettered chaos.~
@114  = ~It was a glorious battle against the Talassar - but glory requires a just cause, and the Lathanderites would have gone beyond self-defense if we had not stopped them.~
@115  = ~Kossuth gives us fire as a tool - to consume that which must burn, but not to blaze unconstrained. It was right to restrain the Lathanderites.~
@116  = ~I am honored to have sustained our faiths' alliance, and to have done my part to prevent open warfare in the streets.~
@117  = ~Do not guess at my motives, servant of Helm. It suited my purposes to help you today. Tomorrow, we shall see.~
@118  = ~Open warfare would have brought ruin to all of Athkatla, the students of the Art not least. I served Mystra's will this day; she would not wish the Lathanderites to pursue their empty vengeance.~
@119  = ~Defending the Lathanderites from attack was noble, but to have stood back and allowed them to butcher the Talassar in revenge would have gone against the teachings of Tyr.~
@120  = ~Your words are wise, <CHARNAME>. This alliance of Oghma and Helm may yet bring peace and wisdom to Athkatla.~
@121  = ~A wise judgement. I am glad that our faiths were able to work together in this matter.~
@122  = ~You are uncommonly wise for one of your dark faith. See that your Lord's goals remain aligned with order and justice, though, if you wish to remain our ally.~
@123  = ~You are wise to temper your battle-lust. It is a powerful weapon for order, but it is good that you know when to sheathe that weapon.~
@124  = ~You are uncommonly wise for one of your faith. Too many of your brethren simply exult in the destructive power of the flame, but you see its purpose more clearly, I think.~
@125  = ~The honor is ours, Sonnlinor. The dwarven folk - all the folk of Athkatla - are fortunate to have your shield protecting them.~
@126  = ~As you wish. What matters to us is the result, not your reasons for bringing it about.~
@127  = ~I know little of your goddess, but I am glad that her path and the Watcher's ran together in this sad business.~
@128  = ~Your honor is exceeded only by your prowess in battle. I regret that you did not come to serve the Vigilant One, but you are a champion of your own faith.~
@129  = ~Such is the burden of Helm's watchers - a burden that you have shared this day.~
@130  = ~<CHARNAME>, you have shown your worth to Helm a hundredfold over, even if your own faith is elsewhere. Your have a place here whenever you wish it - the safety and convenience of this temple is yours to enjoy. Remember that you are in the gaze of the Vigilant One, and go with honor.~
@131  = ~No, <CHARNAME>, this is a tragic failing on your part. I was a fool to trust your judgement and your faith. Others will clean up this mess in time. Your work here is done. Go.~
@132  = ~Neither can this continuing slaughter. I will stand with the Great Guard to stop it.~
@133  = ~Helm stands for protection, and today, so do I.~
@134  = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>! I have a chance for you to unleash the Beastlord's savagery and earn Talos's great favor!~
@135  = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>! I pray that the icy touch of Auril will serve Talos today, to the benefit of both our faiths!~
@136  = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>! Our faiths differ greatly, but we worked together well in crushing the beholder cult, and I hope that we might do so again today. The arcane puissance of Azuth and the destructive fury of Talos, working together to the benefit of both our faiths!~
@137  = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>! I offer a chance to spread fear, hatred and destruction - the lifeblood of your god, and of mine!~
@138  = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>! We do not trust one another, of course, but I am sure you will see the benefits in aiding me, and aiding the Talassar. The Prince of Lies and the Stormlord can find common cause this one time.~
@139  = ~Welcome, Bloodspear! I can count on a servant of mighty Gruumsh to pursue a course of mayhem and destruction - truly, only Talos himself can match your lord's fury!~
@140  = ~Welcome, Firewalker! I know that you truly embrace the destructive terror of fire - and tonight that fire will burn across the rooftops of Athkatla as all marvel at the power of Talos and of Kossuth!~
@141  = ~Welcome, Demarch! I know that our ways lack the subtlety your god esteems - but there is great profit to be gained here, for you and your cause. When this night is done, the servants of Mask will be free to operate in Athkatla without the wretched attention of our shared enemy.~
@142  = ~Welcome, Nightcloak! Though the ways of our faiths differ greatly, still we have a common enemy: the servants of dawn and light.~
@143  = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>. Once again I must call on the secret alliance between our faiths. But know that if you aid us this night, great honor and great profit will be yours.~
@144  = ~Welcome, Talontar. I know of the dark and spiteful goals of your cult, and I exult in them! Together we willl bring destruction and ruin, and profit aplenty for your church and ours.~
@145  = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>! You have always been a champion of the bloodiest aspects of your god. Tonight, I offer a chance for glorious battle, glorious chaos, glorious ruin!~
@146  = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>! Our faiths have often worked together to great glory and profit, and today they will do so again, and you will earn Talos's great favor!~
@147  = ~Do you know well the name of the Morninglord, Lathander? Remember it well, for it is the name of the enemy. On them you will bring ruin in the holy cause of death and mayhem.~
@148  = ~All will fear our alliance. What must I do?~
@149  = ~It was a High Hunt like no other - the high priest of mewling Lathander struck down in Malar's name!~
@150  = ~And the cold fury of the Frostmaiden has been unleashed!~
@151  = ~I care not. I aided you here for my own reasons.~
@152  = ~I sought not just destruction, but fear. Now the weaklings of Athkatla know that they will be safe only if they submit~
@153  = ~Do not think that this is more than a temporary alliance, Nallahir. Cyric brooks no rival.~
@154  = ~The blood flowed! The thunder rolled! Truly, this was a night of mayhem!~
@155  = ~The temple of the Morninglord burns! The fires rise to the night, and all Athkatla will fear the fury of Kossuth!~
@156  = ~My lord prefers a subtler touch, yet this serves his will also. In the night, our wrath came; Athkatla awoke to it, and learned to fear us.~
@157  = ~Dawn will never come for those fools. Darkness has taken them, and the morning could not save them.~
@158  = ~And my lord, too, will be pleased. The meddling Lathanderites far too often interfere with his goals.~
@159  = ~And Athkatla has learned to fear the Lady of Poison. Her dark repute can only grow after tonight's deeds.~
@160  = ~It was a glorious battle! The Lathanderites fought bravely - they were worthy opponents!~
@161  = ~I hope his death was long and bloody, as your creed demands. But you have done Talos's will, regardless!~
@162  = ~Indeed, the icy touch of your mistress claimed the Lathanderites! But you have done Talos's will, regardless!~
@163  = ~Eh, if you wish to see it thus, do so - but you have done Talos's will, regardless!~
@164  = ~And only if they fear Talos, and your dark Lord! A good lesson, my friend, and a good day!~
@165  = ~And Talos does not care for upstart gods! But let us not quarrel in the moment of victory. You have done Talos's will, regardless of your own motives.~
@166  = ~Indeed! An orgy of destruction, enough to sate both our gods for the moment. Here, let us drink to ruin and blood!~
@167  = ~Indeed they will - the fire of Kossuth, and the thunder of Talos! You have done the Storm Lord's will today, even as you serve your own master.~
@168  = ~Indeed. The shadow has fallen on the Lathanderites, and it will not lift. You have done the Storm Lord's will today, even as you serve your own master.~
@169  = ~Talos does not care for these subtleties - but what of it? We may have had different reasons for our alliance, but our triumph is beyond doubt!~
@170  = ~Our alliance remains strong, and benefits us both. You have done the Storm Lord's will today, even as you serve your own master.~
@171  = ~Let it be so! You have done the Storm Lord's will today, even as you serve your own mistress. Talos will not begrudge her share of fame.~
@172  = ~Worthy or not, their blood stains their burning temple, and that is what matters to the Storm Lord! You have done his will today!~
@173  = ~You have sanctuary here for as long as you wish it, for you walk with Talos, whether you acknowledge it or not. Let your footfalls crush the hopes of the peaceful everywhere!~
@174  = ~The destroyer returns! Welcome, and know your very shadow is respected here. Just don't stay too long lest your many enemies track you here. No offense.~
@175  = ~And since you are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of faith and a worthy ally of our church, I will grant you a boon that is seldom given to those not of our faith.~
@176  = ~And since you are a follower of Sune, I have a special gift for you - an artifact of your goddess that was left in our care some years past. You have served well the cause of Lathander. Go in peace.~
@177  = ~But mere gold is not worthy of your service. You are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of faith and a true ally to Helm's cause. You deserve greater tools, even if they are seldom given to those not of our faith.~
@178  = ~As an ally of our church, you have earned a true blessing. Your survival is now valued, so you will be given tools to assure it is so.~
