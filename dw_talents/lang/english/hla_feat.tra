Even if the saves are successful, the target becomes slowed for one round.

@3045="Channeling blasphemous power from the Lower Planes, the blackguard calls forth a pillar of hellfire that consumes mortal foes.

Demons are capricious and it can never be guaranteed which demons will respect the pact, but in general only Balors and demon lords will dare to refuse the blackguard's command, though the demon will remain at the blackguard's side for only a single turn before departing.

The blackguard takes a terrible risk in making the pact. Each time <PRO_HESHE> uses this ability, <PRO_HESHE> has a 10% chance of forfeiting <PRO_HISHER> soul to <PRO_HISHER> patron.

The contracts of the Hells are so byzantine that it can never be guaranteed which baatezu will be bound by the contract, but in general only the mighty Pit Fiends - and baatezu of similar power - are unconstrained by it; other baatezu must obey without question, though the length of their service is only one turn and they will depart immediately afterwards.

Creatures below 10 Hit Dice die immediately, and even those above this level suffer 10 points of magical damage.

In addition to the instant effects, the destructive energies keep weakening the target, who will suffer an additional 1 point penalty to Constitution and saves vs. death every second round for 1 turn. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. death every time to avoid further negative effects.

Finger of Destruction can only be used once per day."

This state allows them to judge combat situations more wisely and react to the surrounding world much more quickly and effectively. 

Inner Time not simply hastens the mind; the body becomes faster too. A spectator would find the monk's movement and actions incredibly fast. <PRO_HISHER> fists become more dangerous than any other weapon: <PRO_HESHE> gets 8 attacks/round, <PRO_HISHER> damage, THAC0 and AC get a 4 points bonus, attack and casting speeds are also reduced by 2. <PRO_HESHE> can catch missiles and throw them back to the attacker with the same move, and is protected from backstabs.

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: Special

An experienced Bard eventually learns to influence the actions of <PRO_HISHER> opponents. By focusing <PRO_HISHER> willpower a Bard can suggest a course of activity which opponents feel strongly compelled to follow. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out and break the enchantment. If a common language is shared, the Bard can generally force the subjects to perform as <PRO_HESHE> desires, within the limits of their abilities. If no common language is shared, the character can communicate only by using basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," "Stand still" etc. Opponents can attempt a saving throw vs. spells in order to avoid being controlled, but even if they succeed, there is still a 25% chance that they will suffer a mental breakdown from the amount of stress that their minds have suffered. This will effectively cause them to enter a Berserk state (no save) and attack the nearest creature for one round.

This ability completely ignores any magic resistance of the targets. However, it has no effect on undead, or on mindless creatures such as constructs and slimes. The racial charm resistance of Elves and Half-Elves also applies.~

By softly humming a subtly hypnotic tune, an experienced Bard can captivate and enthrall any audience, even creatures that do not understand <PRO_HISHER> language. Opponents in the area of effect must successfully save vs. paralyzation or give the Bard their undivided attention, totally ignoring their surroundings and becoming fascinated for the following five rounds. Fascinated creatures can take no actions for the duration of the effect; however, they can still perceive danger on a subconscious level, so any hostile action taken against them automatically breaks this state. In addition, even if opponents make their saving throws and avoid the fascination effect, there is still a 25% chance that they will become confused for one round (no save) from being too deeply immersed into the hypnotic pattern of the song.

This ability completely ignores any magic resistance of the targets. However, it has no effect on mindless creatures such as Constructs, Skeletons, Zombies and Slimes.~

The Bard magically amplifies the capabilities of a musical instrument in order to fill <PRO_HISHER> surroundings with high-pitched, stone-shattering sound waves. Creatures in the nearby area take 15d6 points of sonic damage and are also deafened for five rounds. Deafened creatures suffer a 50% chance of spellcasting failure. A successful save vs. breath halves the damage and negates the deafness.

The target's Magic Damage Resistance is also set to 25%. In addition, the adamantite body can only be harmed by +3 weapons or better. While the new form doesn't allow the use of
weapons, the hands will be more than capable for battle - they both act as +4 weapons, deal 4d6 points of damage and are used with grandmaster level of proficiency. However, the target's casting time is increased by 4 as long as the spell lasts."

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 Creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

By casting this terrible spell, the caster attempts to magically destroy the target creature's body and turn it into a Flesh Golem, controlled by the caster. The target must make a save vs. polymorph to avoid instant death and transformation, but even if the save is successful, it will suffer 3d6 +3 points of damage because of the physical shock. Creatures of 12th level or below receive no saving throw. The newly created Flesh Golem will obey every command of the Transmuter. Only living humanoids are affected by the transformation.

Normally golems are created in a long and arduous process. The magical bonds in their bodies require tremendous amounts of time and enchantments to be made permanent. The hastened method of this spell's transformation has its drawbacks naturally: any Flesh Golems created by this spell will decay into nothing after 1 hour."

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 10
Range: 30 yards
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell is used primarily against hostile spellcasters. It distorts all attempts at spell casting, converting spell energy into wild surges. 

The victim of a wildstrike is allowed a saving throw vs. spells at a -2 penalty: even if the save is successful, the spell has some effect and the target becomes a subject of wild magic for the following 2 rounds (when the victim casts a spell or uses a charge from a magical item, a wild surge is automatically created). 
If the saving throw is failed, the target is enclosed within a deadlier field of wild magic: the effect lasts 2 turns.

@3169="Demon Binding"
@3170="Demon Binding
Through perusal of forbidden texts and conversations of a questionable nature, the character has learned some of the secrets of the fiends of the lower planes, and - through dark pacts, fragments of true names, and raw power - can exercise a modicum of control over some of them. When using the mage spells Summon Fiend and Cacofiend to bring forth a fiend, the character will bind the fiend called forth to obey <PRO_HISHER> will, instead of simply leaving it to rampage at random.

Most wizards avoid demon binding for good reason: <PRO_HESHE> who trafficks with fiends puts <PRO_HISHER> immortal soul at risk. Each time the character summons and binds a fiend, there is a 10% chance that <PRO_HISHER> alignment will shift one step towards evil. If <PRO_HESHE> is already evil, there is instead a 10% chance that <PRO_HISHER> soul will be forfeit to the denizens of the lower planes. A character whose soul is lost in this way cannot be resurrected from the dead - once slain, <PRO_HESHE> is forever lost.

This ability may be taken twice. When taken a second time, the character gains the ability to bind even the mighty fiends called forth by the Gate spell. When doing so, the risk of the character sliding towards evil, or of forfeiting <PRO_HISHER> soul, increases to 25%."

In addition, the caster gains the ability to cast an innate 'Reveal Area' spell, up to once per round: this requires just a minimal and instantaneous shift of concentration (so that further spell casting is not prevented), and allows <PRO_HIMHER> to focus on a specific portion of the current area and see from a distance all that is happening there.

This high level spell infects the subject with progressive forgetfulness. On a failed save, every round the subject loses his highest-level spell (excluding 10th level or Quest spells) or spell slot. Each subsequent round the subject loses another spell or spell slot, moving to lower level spells once all the higher level spells are gone. In the first round the target is allowed a saving throw vs. spells at a -4 penalty. Every round thereafter there is a chance that the affected victim will lose a spell from the repertoire. The chance of this spell loss is reduced every 5th round by 5% (e.g. the target has 100% chance to lose a spell every round in the first five rounds, and only 75% in the 26-30th rounds). While fighting the effects of a Spell Worm, the caster has a 25% greater chance of spell failure every time he attempts to cast a spell, unless a successful save vs. spell (at -4) is made in the first round. Even if the save is successful however, the mental distraction causes the affected creature to fail every spellcasting attempt for 2 rounds. The spell's effects last for 5 turns."

The power of the spell is such that there is no saving throw against its effects, and magic resistance - including the resilience of elves against charm and domination - is useless against it.

The wolf spirits' attacks bypass defenses against magical weapons and always hit, inflicting either 3d8 slashing or 3d8 piercing damage; a save vs spells at -2 reduces this by half. The pack are invisible and cannot be harmed by weapons or spells."

Level: 10
Range: Sight
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them down into the deepest depths of the Abyss. After only a few seconds as measured by outside observers, the portal reopens and the victim (or what's left of them) gets spit back out.

If the victim makes a successful saving throw, they will get spit out of the portal in 'one piece', but while the victim senses nothing at first, after a split-second, all the wrath of the Tanar'ri will surface. The victim will suffer 10d10 slashing damage over the course of 1 round as they suffer multiple delayed attacks and slashes from all angles.

If the victim fails the saving throw, it is instant death. All that is left are body parts.

Very large creatures, like dragons, are too large to be consumed by the portal."
