<p><p>Most High-Level Abilities available to mages are 10th-level spells, which are listed <a href="hlas_10thlevel.html">here</a>. However, this page lists the comparatively-few abilities available to high-level mages which are not 10th level spells.</p><p>Note that this list assumes a full install of Talents of Faerun, excluding the 'new low-level abilities' component. If you have a partial install, your High-Level Ability system may differ from the one documented here in small ways.</p></p>

<p><h3><a id="AK_PLACEHOLDER" name="AK_PLACEHOLDER"></a>Arcane Knowledge </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The time and effort powerful wizards put into the study of complex spells, magical artifacts and the very essence of magic does not happen without rewards. The wizard's studies open his/her mind to new ways of thinking and perceiving the multiverse. <br>
his/her extensive knowledge will give him/her the answer to even the most obscure problem; the broadening of his/her mental faculties make him/her capable of learning and memorizing an even greater variety of magic.<br>
gives the character the ability to select high-level abilities associated with a specific school of magic.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> able to cast ninth-level arcane spells.<br>
<br>
<b>Restrictions:</b> not available to spellcasters who lack access to this school of magic.<br>
<br>
<b>Special:</b> this ability can be taken multiple times, granting access to a new school of magic each time. Specialists in a school of magic, and sorcerers with a bloodline granting special affinity to that school, do not need to take Arcane Knowledge in that school to gain access to its High-Level Abilities.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLDBI" name="DW-HLDBI"></a>Demon Binding </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Through perusal of forbidden texts and conversations of a questionable nature, the character has learned some of the secrets of the fiends of the lower planes, and - through dark pacts, fragments of true names, and raw power - can exercise a modicum of control over some of them. When using the mage spells Summon Fiend and Cacofiend to bring forth a fiend, the character will bind the fiend called forth to obey his/her will, instead of simply leaving it to rampage at random.<br>
<br>
Most wizards avoid demon binding for good reason: he/she who trafficks with fiends puts his/her immortal soul at risk. Each time the character summons and binds a fiend, there is a 10% chance that his/her alignment will shift one step towards evil. If he/she is already evil, there is instead a 10% chance that his/her soul will be forfeit to the denizens of the lower planes. A character whose soul is lost in this way cannot be resurrected from the dead - once slain, he/she is forever lost.<br>
<br>
This ability may be taken twice. When taken a second time, the character gains the ability to bind even the mighty fiends called forth by the Gate spell. When doing so, the risk of the character sliding towards evil, or of forfeiting his/her soul, increases to 25%.<br>
<br>

<br>
This passive ability enhances castings of the divination spells Detect Invisibility, Oracle, True Sight, and Reveal.
