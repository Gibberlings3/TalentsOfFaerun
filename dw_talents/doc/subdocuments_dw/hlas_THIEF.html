<p><h3><a id="TG#ACRO" name="TG#ACRO"></a>Acrobatics </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Swashbucklers are known as great fighters, but their training concentrates more on movement and agility instead of pure strength and devastating blows. By further enhancing their acrobatic and dodging skills, swashbucklers may become more formidable opponents in battle.<br>
This passive ability permanently increases Dexterity by 1, grants a +1 bonus to base armor class, and grants a 2 point bonus to any save vs. breath.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Swashbuckler.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DWHPT5" name="DWHPT5"></a>Alchemy: Rogues' Potions </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>With cleverness innate to the class, an experienced rogue has seen enough potions in his/her adventuring career to simulate the creation of one. Brewing potions requires the expenditure of gold on the raw materials (equal to the cost of buying the potion in a store) and draws slightly on the character's life force (equivalent to a loss of 1 experience point per gold piece cost).<br>
<br>
The character may brew the following potions:<br>
Antidote<br>
Oil of Speed<br>
Potion of Agility<br>
Potion of Explosions<br>
Potion of Extra Healing<br>
Potion of Healing<br>
Potion of Infravision<br>
Potion of Invisibility<br>
Potion of Master Thievery<br>
Potion of Mind Focusing<br>
Potion of Perception<br>
Potion of Power<br>
Rogue's Potion of Frost Giant Strength<br>

<p><h3><a id="SPCL916" name="SPCL916"></a>Assassination </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Using every clever trick an experienced Thief has learned in countless battles, this ability allows every strike in the next round to act as a backstab, using the Thief's existing backstab modifier to determine damage.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Thief.<br>
<br>
<b>Restrictions:</b> not available to Swashbuckler.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL913" name="SPCL913"></a>Avoid Danger </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>A rogue's natural sense of preservation becomes heightened with the use of the Avoid Danger ability.

During the round when this ability is activated, every attack of the thief deals maximum damage and may weaken his/her target. On each successful hit the victim must make a saving throw vs. death (with a -4 penalty) or have its strength score lowered to 10 for the next five rounds. Note: Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures are completely unaffected by this ability.<br>

During the round when this ability is activated, the Swashbuckler receives a +5 bonus to his/her critical hit rolls and deals maximum damage with each attack.<br>

<p><h3><a id="DWPSS5" name="DWPSS5"></a>Nerve Venom </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This compound partially paralyses its victim, reducing their attack rolls, damage and AC by 4 and giving them a 25% spell failure chance. The effects of the poison last for five rounds, and there is no saving throw against the effect. The poison does not otherwise damage the victim. <br>
<br>
No creature can be affected by the poison more often than once per round.<br>

<p><h3><a id="RR#THL04" name="RR#THL04"></a>Set Acid Trap </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability allows the rogue to set a powerful trap that splashes nearby opponents with a highly vitriolic alchemical mixture which deals 10d6 points of acid damage. Once the acid engulfs a target it becomes difficult to remove. Afflicted opponents must make a saving throw vs. breath or take an additional 2d6 points of acid damage during each of the following three rounds. Creatures who are particularly vulnerable to acid damage (such as Trolls) do not get a saving throw. Note that because the trap's acid is alchemical rather than magical in nature, it bypasses magic resistance.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Thief.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL911" name="SPCL911"></a>Set Exploding Trap </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability allows the rogue to set a powerful trap that unleashes a fireball which causes 15d6 damage (Save vs. Spell for half damage) and will knock its victims off their feet (sufficiently large creatures are unaffected). Note that because the trap's explosion is alchemical rather than magical in nature, it bypasses magic resistance.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Thief.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL910" name="SPCL910"></a>Set Spike Trap </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability allows the rogue to set a powerful spring-loaded spike trap that does 20d6 damage to the unsuspecting creature that sets it off.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Thief.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#TOXT" name="TG#TOXT"></a>Set Toxic Trap </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability allows the Bounty Hunter to set a specific trap that sets off poisonous toxins when triggered. The poisonous cloud deals 1 poison damage/sec for 15 rounds (save vs. poison for half) and reduces the movement rate of enemies by 75% for 3 rounds (no save). If a living target creature is exposed to the toxins, it must make a saving throw vs. death to avoid falling unconscious. The duration of this state depends on the saving throw penalties (3 rounds if the victim fails the save at 0, 2 rounds if at -2 and one round if at -4). In addition to these effects, the toxins drain 3 points of Constitution from any opponents who fail to save vs. breath at -4.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bounty Hunter.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL938" name="SPCL938"></a>Shadow Form </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability temporarily transposes some of the user's tissue with shadow-material, making the subject partially incorporeal. For the next 5 rounds, all physical attacks directed against the Shadowdancer only deal 50% of their normal damage. During this time, the Shadowdancer is also under the effects of Improved Invisibility and cannot be directly targeted by spells.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Shadowdancer.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL937" name="SPCL937"></a>Shadow Maze </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability opens a temporary gateway to a small pocket within the Plane of Shadow. All enemies within 7 feet of the Shadowdancer must make a Save vs. Spell at a -4 penalty or become trapped inside a shadowy labyrinth as per the Maze spell.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Shadowdancer.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL936" name="SPCL936"></a>Shadow Twin </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability creates an almost exact duplicate of the Shadowdancer for 2 turns. The duplicate is created at 60% of the level at which the Shadowdancer is currently on. It has all the abilities that the Shadowdancer would have at that level. It also has 60% of the Hit Points of the Shadowdancer. The duplicate is fully under the control of the Shadowdancer.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Shadowdancer.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLSLP" name="DW-HLSLP"></a>Slippery Mind </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This rogue can occasionally manage to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel him/her. The first time he/she fails a saving throw against charm, domination, or similar magic, he/she is nonetheless unaffected. This ability can function at most once per hour.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bard or high level Thief.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL922" name="SPCL922"></a>Tracking </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>With an intimate knowledge of his/her surroundings and the creatures that live within them, the character can use the Tracking ability to give him/herself a general idea of what creatures are in an area and which direction they are. Red arrows at the edge of the screen will point in the general direction of the creatures in the area.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bounty Hunter or high level Ranger.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL915" name="SPCL915"></a>Use Any Item </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Rogues take pride in their ability to adapt and make clever use of whatever is at hand. This ability is an extension of that basic skill. Once learned, the effect is permanent. The ability allows the rogue to use any item, even items that are typically restricted to one class. This allows the rogue to use everything from wands and scrolls to mighty weapons that none but a warrior could otherwise use.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Use Wands.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bard or high level Thief.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-FTSCR" name="DW-FTSCR"></a>Use Scrolls </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Thieves often pick up some of the rudiments of arcane magic over their careers. This passive ability permits the thief to use wizard scrolls.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Thief.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-FTWND" name="DW-FTWND"></a>Use Wands </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Some experienced thieves make a careful study of magical items, learning in due course how to use wands as well as scrolls. This passive ability permits the thief to use any wand usually restricted to wizards and bards.<br>
<br>

<p><h3><a id="SPCL900" name="SPCL900"></a>Whirlwind Attack </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability allows the warrior to unleash a flurry of super-fast blows.
