<p>This documents the Tales of Faerun version of the original-game kits (excluding specialist mages and speciality priests). Most of the changes are from the 'Rebalanced and Revised Kits' component, but the Holy Smite powers of the undead hunter and cavalier are from 'Revised Smite Evil' and the changes to avenger shapeshifting are from 'Revised Druid Shapeshifting'.</p>

<div class="section">
This Druid is not called Shapeshifter because he/she has access to a great variety of forms, but rather because of his/her complete dedication to a single alternate form. This Druid has willingly allowed him/herself to become infected with lycanthropy, but due to intense study and training he/she has the ability to control his/her affliction. The creature he/she becomes is that of the werewolf, the most famous of the lycanthrope shape changers.

<div class="section">
This is a warrior who is in tune with his/her animalistic side and, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable him/her to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any person has a right to. Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes. Regardless, opponents on the battlefield will be unsettled when they see the savage and inhuman elements of the Berserker's personality. This class is common amongst dwarves, known to them as the Battlerager.

<h4>Advantages</h4>

<li>May use Rage ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.
