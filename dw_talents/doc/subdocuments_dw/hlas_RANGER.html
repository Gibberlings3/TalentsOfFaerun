<div class="section">
<p><h3><a id="DW-FTAMB" name="DW-FTAMB"></a>Ambidexterity </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The character has learned to use both hands equally when fighting, and no longer suffers an additional -2 penalty with off-hand attack rolls when dual-wielding.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Blade, high level Ranger, or high level Swashbuckler.<br>
<br>
<b>Restrictions:</b> not available to Archer.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL902" name="SPCL902"></a>Deathblow </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The Deathblow ability allows the warrior to blow through the defenses of any lesser creature. For the next 2 rounds, any creature of 10th level or lower is instantly killed when struck by the warrior.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, or high level Ranger.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLEAS" name="DW-HLEAS"></a>Empowered Animal Summoning </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The character's strong bond to the natural world allows him/her to bolster the strength and resilience of the animals he/she summons to his/her side.<br>
<br>
This passive ability causes summoned animals to appear with a +4 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, armor class and a +2 bonus to saving throws, and to have the ability to harm creatures unaffected by nonmagical or +1 weapons. The spells affected are Animal Summoning (any rank) and Conjure Animals. The power does not affect summoned elementals or fey.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Beast Master or high level Druid.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#ENDU" name="TG#ENDU"></a>Endurance </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>High-level rangers are capable of tremendous feats of stamina and endurance, from tireless marches to perseverence despite grave injuries and hardships.<br>
<br>
This passive ability grants the ranger a 20% boost to movement rate, immunity to fatigue and unconsciousness, a 10% bonus to maximum hit points, and a +1 bonus to saving throws and attack rolls.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Ranger.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="FAVORED_ENEMY_PLACEHOLDER" name="FAVORED_ENEMY_PLACEHOLDER"></a>Extra Favored Enemy </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The character adds an additional creature type to his/her list of favored enemies (rangers get +4 to hit and damage vs. favored enemies).<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Ranger<br>
<br>
<b>Special:</b> this ability may be selected multiple times, adding a new favored enemy each time.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL907" name="SPCL907"></a>Hardiness </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Calling upon hidden reserves of strength during times of danger, a warrior can use the Hardiness ability to gain 40% resistance to all forms of physical damage. The ability lasts for 1 round for every 2 levels of the warrior.<br>
<br>
This ability does not stack with Defensive Stance.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, or high level Ranger.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="NEMESIS_PLACEHOLDER" name="NEMESIS_PLACEHOLDER"></a>Nemesis </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The character gains an additional +4 to damage, and +2 to armor class and saving throws, against one of his/her favored enemy types. <br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> Ranger<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Favored Enemy (this creature type)<br>
<br>
<b>Special:</b> this ability may be selected multiple times, adding a new nemesis each time.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL906" name="SPCL906"></a>Power Attack </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>A Power Attack allows the warrior to strike blows so forceful that they stun an opponent for 2 rounds if the opponent fails a Save vs. Death at a -4 penalty. The ability lasts for 2 rounds.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, high level Ranger, or high level Skald.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#PREC" name="TG#PREC"></a>Precision </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>With proper concentration a skilled archer can render his/her attacks more deadly and precise. By activating this ability the archer gains +6 to his/her attack rolls with missile weapons, +10 bonus to damage for 3 rounds and a 20% chance/hit to strike a lethal hit (the target creature is allowed a save vs. death to avoid instant death). <br>
<br>
Precision has some drawbacks: it requires intense concentration, making defense difficult, and leaves time for just half of the normally available attacks. The archer's movement rate will be significantly decreased and his/her AC will suffer a 5 point penalty until the ability expires.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Archer.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL904" name="SPCL904"></a>Resist Magic </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability allows the warrior to temporarily tap a great inner strength and fight off the effects of malevolent magic. For 4 rounds, the warrior's Magic Resistance is set to 50%. This is not cumulative with other forms of Magic Resistance, so if the warrior already has 50% Magic Resistance or greater, the ability is useless.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, or high level Ranger.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL922" name="SPCL922"></a>Tracking </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>With an intimate knowledge of his/her surroundings and the creatures that live within them, the character can use the Tracking ability to give him/herself a general idea of what creatures are in an area and which direction they are. Red arrows at the edge of the screen will point in the general direction of the creatures in the area.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bounty Hunter or high level Ranger.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL900" name="SPCL900"></a>Whirlwind Attack </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability allows the warrior to unleash a flurry of super-fast blows. The ability sets one's number of attacks per round to 10, but one's THAC0 and damage suffer a 4 point penalty. The Whirlwind Attack lasts for one round.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, high level Ranger, or high level Swashbuckler.</p></div>
