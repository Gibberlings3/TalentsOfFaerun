<p><h3><a id="DW-HLBAB" name="DW-HLBAB"></a>Abyssal Pact </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The blackguard has come to an arrangement with a mighty demon lord; in exchange for present and future favors too hideous to contemplate, the blackguard may use the demon lord's patronage to command the service of a marilith, glabrezu, nabassu or other demon once per day. Demons are capricious and it can never be guaranteed which demons will respect the pact, but in general only Balors and demon lords will dare to refuse the blackguard's command, though the demon will remain at the blackguard's side for only a single turn before departing.<br>
<br>
The blackguard takes a terrible risk in making the pact. Each time he/she uses this ability, he/she has a 10% chance of forfeiting his/her soul to his/her patron. If this happens, the blackguard will not be able to be resurrected after his/her death: he/she will be forever lost.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Blood War Secrets; may not be Lawful.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLBWS" name="DW-HLBWS"></a>Blood War Secrets </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The fiends of the lower planes constantly war against one another: baatezu dukes contest for control of the nine hells of Baator, demon lords pursue aeons-old rivalry, and the Blood War between baatezu and tanar'ri rages on. The most vile of blackguards have learned many of the hard-won fighting methods that the fiends have acquired against one another.<br>
<br>
This passive ability gives the blackguard a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls when fighting lower-planar creatures.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL902" name="SPCL902"></a>Deathblow </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The Deathblow ability allows the warrior to blow through the defenses of any lesser creature. For the next 2 rounds, any creature of 10th level or lower is instantly killed when struck by the warrior.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, or high level Ranger.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DWPSS4" name="DWPSS4"></a>Deathkiss </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This compound causes instant death in weaker victims. Anyone struck by the poison suffers 6 poison damage (no save) and then must make a save vs. poison at -2. Creatures with 60 or fewer hit points die instantly if they fail the saving throw; other creatures who fail their saving throw take 1 hit point of damage per second for 24 seconds.<br>
<br>
No creature can be affected by the poison more often than once per round.<br>
<br>
Characters with this ability can opt to use this poison when they activate their Poison Weapon ability.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Assassin or high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL907" name="SPCL907"></a>Hardiness </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Calling upon hidden reserves of strength during times of danger, a warrior can use the Hardiness ability to gain 40% resistance to all forms of physical damage. The ability lasts for 1 round for every 2 levels of the warrior.<br>
<br>
This ability does not stack with Defensive Stance.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, or high level Ranger.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLHRM" name="DW-HLHRM"></a>Harm (Necromancy)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Sphere: Necromantic<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Duration: Permanent<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell is the reverse of Heal. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. On a successful touch from the priest, the spell reduces the target to 1 Hit Point. The next attack that the priest makes will inflict this effect; however, he/she only has 2 rounds to make the attack before the spell fizzles. If the priest misses the target creature, the spell is wasted. There is no Saving Throw.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLBIC" name="DW-HLBIC"></a>Infernal Contract </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The blackguard has signed a contract with a high-ranking power in the Nine Hells - perhaps one of the Dark Eight, the pit fiends who oversee the Blood War; perhaps a being darker still. The long-term consequences for the blackguard's soul are dire, but in the short term, he/she is able, once per day, to demand the allegiance of a cornugon, abishai or other baatezu devil. The contracts of the Hells are so byzantine that it can never be guaranteed which baatezu will be bound by the contract, but in general only the mighty Pit Fiends - and baatezu of similar power - are unconstrained by it; other baatezu must obey without question, though the length of their service is only one turn and they will depart immediately afterwards.<br>
<br>
Each time the blackguard uses this ability, he/she has a 10% chance of forfeiting his/her soul to his/her patron. If this happens, the blackguard will not be able to be resurrected after his/her death: he/she will be forever lost.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Blood War Secrets; may not be Chaotic.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DWPSS5" name="DWPSS5"></a>Nerve Venom </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This compound partially paralyses its victim, reducing their attack rolls, damage and AC by 4 and giving them a 25% spell failure chance. The effects of the poison last for five rounds, and there is no saving throw against the effect. The poison does not otherwise damage the victim. <br>
<br>
No creature can be affected by the poison more often than once per round.<br>
<br>
Characters with this ability can opt to use this poison when they activate their Poison Weapon ability.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Assassin or high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLPAP" name="DW-HLPAP"></a>Poison Aptitude </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The assassin has learned the skill of brewing exceptionally potent poisons. Saving throws against his/her Poison Weapon ability now suffer an additional -2 penalty.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Assassin or high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLPEX" name="DW-HLPEX"></a>Poison Expertise </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The assassin's understanding of poison brewing deepens. The -2 saving throw penalty imposed by the Poison Aptitude ability now increases to -4.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Poison Aptitude.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Assassin or high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL906" name="SPCL906"></a>Power Attack </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>A Power Attack allows the warrior to strike blows so forceful that they stun an opponent for 2 rounds if the opponent fails a Save vs. Death at a -4 penalty. The ability lasts for 2 rounds.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, high level Ranger, or high level Skald.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLPRF" name="DW-HLPRF"></a>Profane Fire </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Channeling blasphemous power from the Lower Planes, the blackguard calls forth a pillar of hellfire that consumes mortal foes. The victim suffers 20d6 points of damage (save vs. spells for half), of which half is fire and half is magic damage. Profane fire has no effect on undead or lower-planar creatures.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL904" name="SPCL904"></a>Resist Magic </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability allows the warrior to temporarily tap a great inner strength and fight off the effects of malevolent magic. For 4 rounds, the warrior's Magic Resistance is set to 50%. This is not cumulative with other forms of Magic Resistance, so if the warrior already has 50% Magic Resistance or greater, the ability is useless.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, or high level Ranger.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLBSB" name="DW-HLBSB"></a>Summon Balor </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>As a consequence of the blackguard's pact with a demon lord, he/she may now, once per day, command the services of a terrible Balor demon drawn forth from the Abyss. The summoned fiend will faithfully obey the blackguard's commands.<br>
<br>
Each time the blackguard uses this ability, he/she has a 25% chance of forfeiting his/her soul to his/her patron. If this happens, the blackguard will not be able to be resurrected after his/her death: he/she will be forever lost.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Abyssal Pact.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLBSP" name="DW-HLBSP"></a>Summon Pit Fiend </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>As a consequence of the blackguard's contract with an infernal power, he/she may now, once per day, command the services of a mighty Pit Fiend drawn forth from Baator. The summoned fiend will faithfully obey the blackguard's commands.<br>
<br>
Each time the blackguard uses this ability, he/she has a 25% chance of forfeiting his/her soul to his/her patron. If this happens, the blackguard will not be able to be resurrected after his/her death: he/she will be forever lost.<br>

<b>Prerequisite:</b> Infernal Contract.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL900" name="SPCL900"></a>Whirlwind Attack </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability allows the warrior to unleash a flurry of super-fast blows. The ability sets one's number of attacks per round to 10, but one's THAC0 and damage suffer a 4 point penalty. The Whirlwind Attack lasts for one round.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, high level Ranger, or high level Swashbuckler.</p></div>
