<p>These are the 10th level spells available to high-level mages and sorcerers. 10th level spells are grouped by school, and require the Arcane Knowledge high-level ability for that school. Specialist wizards automatically get access to 10th level spells in their speciality school. If you are using the Talents of Faerun bloodline system for sorcerers, each sorcerer bloodline receives access to one school of 10th level spells automatically (the specific school depends on the bloodline).</p>

<p><h3><a id="TG#ADAM" name="TG#ADAM"></a>Adamantite Body (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 1<br>
Duration: 6 rounds +1 round/5 levels<br>
Casting Time: 7<br>
Area of Effect: Creature Touched<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This is an improved version of the mage spell Iron Body; it turns the target creature's body into living adamantite. <br>
<br>
The new metallic body has many advantages: it reduces AC by 5, grants complete immunity to elemental and poison based attacks, and offers 90% resistance to magical and physical attacks. The target's Magic Damage Resistance is also set to 25%. In addition, the adamantite body can only be harmed by +3 weapons or better. While the new form doesn't allow the use of<br>
weapons, the hands will be more than capable for battle - they both act as +4 weapons, deal 4d6 points of damage and are used with grandmaster level of proficiency. However, the target's casting time is increased by 4 as long as the spell lasts.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Arcane Knowledge: Abjuration, or Abjurer, or Sorcerer (Celestial Bloodline).<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> able to cast ninth-level arcane spells.<br>

Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell confers upon the mage very powerful protection for a short time. Physical resistances (Slashing, Piercing, Crushing, and Missile) and Elemental resistances are all set to 100%, Magic Damage resistance is set to 60%. The mage gains a total AC bonus of 5 and his/her saving throws are improved by 3 points. In addition to these bonuses Aegis protects the caster from the first spell that would normally remove combat or spell protections. The spell lasts for 5 rounds.<br>

<p><h3><a id="DW-ELSWA" name="DW-ELSWA"></a>Air Elemental Swarm (Conjuration/Summoning)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 30 ft.<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell opens a portal to the Elemental Plane of Air and calls forth air elementals to serve the caster. Upon casting the spell, two 12-HD elementals immediately appear. One round later, a 16-HD elemental appears. One round later still, a 24-HD elemental appears. The elementals serve the caster faithfully, and disappear after 2 turns if they are not destroyed before then.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> able to cast 7th level spells from the Air sphere or high level Air Elementalist.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#COME" name="TG#COME"></a>Comet (Evocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 90 yards<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>
Casting Time: 3<br>
Area of Effect:  30' radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
A more powerful and specialized version of Meteor Swarm, this spell causes a small meteor or comet to strike the earth damaging all enemies in its path and sending out a powerful shockwave that knocks away all creatures in the area of effect. Those knocked down must save vs. breath or be stunned for 3 rounds. The comet itself does 5d10 fire and 5d10 crushing damage.<br>
<br>
This spell will not damage allies of the caster, who are momentarily shielded by the spell itself from the comet's effects.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Arcane Knowledge: Invocation, or Invoker, or Sorcerer (Stormborn Bloodline), or Sorcerer (Rimefrost Bloodline).<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> able to cast ninth-level arcane spells.<br>

<p><h3><a id="TG#GOLE" name="TG#GOLE"></a>Create Flesh Golem (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 20<br>
Duration: Permanent<br>
Casting Time: 8<br>
Area of Effect: 1 Creature<br>
Saving Throw: Neg.<br>
<br>
By casting this terrible spell, the caster attempts to magically destroy the target creature's body and turn it into a Flesh Golem, controlled by the caster. The target must make a save vs. polymorph to avoid instant death and transformation, but even if the save is successful, it will suffer 3d6 +3 points of damage because of the physical shock. Creatures of 12th level or below receive no saving throw. The newly created Flesh Golem will obey every command of the Transmuter.<br>
<br>
Normally golems are created in a long and arduous process. The magical bonds in their bodies require tremendous amounts of time and enchantments to be made permanent. The hastened method of this spell's transformation has its drawbacks naturally: any Flesh Golems created by this spell will decay into nothing after 1 hour.<br>
<br>

<p><h3><a id="TG#BONE" name="TG#BONE"></a>Create Greater Boneguard (Necromancy)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 20 yards<br>
Duration: Special<br>
Casting Time: 8<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
The caster sends a powerful call to the long dead corpses buried deep beneath the earth, constructing a horrifying abomination known as a Greater Boneguard. At high levels (25+) the caster is able to create an Apocalyptic Boneguard, a very fearsome ally. Controlling these powerful undead creatures requires intense concentration and is very draining to the caster; he/she will lose 1d8+5 hit points for creating a Greater Boneguard and 1d12+5 hit points for creating an Apocalyptic Boneguard. Greater Boneguards exist for 10 turns and Apocalyptic Boneguards exist for 7 turns.<br>
<br>

Duration: 1 hour<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 50' radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
By means of this spell necromancers can increase the power of their undead servants. The caster channels dark magic into a single undead ally, increasing its hit points by 100% and granting it +2 to hit, damage, AC, and saving throws, immunity to Turn Undead, the benefits of an Improved Haste spell, and 50% resistance to magic and magical damage. The caster must be careful, though, since casting the spell causes a loss of 3d6 hit points, and requires a save vs. death at -2 to avoid losing one point of Constitution for 50 turns.<br>
<br>

Area of Effect: 50' radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
By casting this powerful necromantic spell, the wizard attacks the life force of every opponent within a 50ft radius. Weaker creatures - summons, creatures with 30 or fewer hit points, or creatures of 12th level or lower - die on the spot. All other creatures must save vs. spell at a -2 modifier or die.<br>

Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This spell causes a disembodied head of a red dragon to appear and breathe fire with the strength of an adult red dragon. In addition to the enormous 20d10 fireball, the force of the dragon's breath knocks an opponent off their feet and away from the caster. The victim can save vs. Breath Weapon to take half damage and not be blown backwards. <br>
<br>
This spell will not harm party members.<br>

An energy blade is a discus made of pure energy. The disc gives +10 to THAC0, and when thrown does 1d4+5 missile damage as well as 1d10 additional electrical damage. This spell creates 1 energy disc per level of the caster and sets the caster's attacks to 9 as long as the discs are held.<br>

Duration: Special<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 30' radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This devastating spell was created by a powerful drow wizard named Malavon, somewhere deep within The Spine of the World. This is the improved version of his spell Malavon's Rage. The caster causes dozens of magical acid darts to strike anyone within a 30' radius. Every creature caught in the area of effect suffers 15D8 points of acid damage (save vs. breath for half). Those who were struck by the spell will suffer additional 1D8 points of damage/round for 3 rounds.<br>
<br>
Malavon's Fury does not affect the caster.<br>

<b>Prerequisite:</b> Arcane Knowledge: Invocation, or Invoker, or Sorcerer (Stormborn Bloodline), or Sorcerer (Rimefrost Bloodline).<br>

Duration: 8 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 20-ft radius<br>
Saving Throw: Negates (-2 penalty)<br>
<br>
The Mass Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of multiple creatures while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victims. Targets are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Arcane Knowledge: Enchantment, or Enchanter, or Sorcerer (Fey Bloodline).<br>

Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Mirrored Clones creates two copies of the caster, perfect duplicates except for the fact that they have just 60% of the levels and hit points of the original individual. These duplicates are able to cast spells and attack under the control of the caster, who is also placed under a mislead-like effect for the entire duration of the spell. The clones are quasi-real phantasms and as such are not vulnerable to effects like Truesight and Detect Illusions.<br>

Duration: 15 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Reveal is the definitive divinatory spell. Once per round, until the spell expires, all hostile illusion/phantasm spells in an area around 70 feet in radius will be dispelled, while the main alignment of any creature not in the caster's party will be revealed (no save).<br>
<br>
In addition, the caster gains the ability to cast an innate 'Reveal Area' spell, up to once per round: this requires just a minimal and instantaneous shift of concentration (so that further spell casting is not prevented), and allows him/her to focus on a specific portion of the current area and see from a distance all that is happening there. Areas 'spied' this way remain visualized in the caster's mind for two rounds after each use of the ability.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Arcane Knowledge: Divination, or Diviner.<br>

Duration: 10 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Upon the casting of this spell, an enchanted rune is placed under the target creature. In a few moments magical energies are collected to form an impenetrable barrier around the target itself, making it immune to all schools of magic for a short time. Not even friendly spells can penetrate this barrier, even though the protected creature may freely cast spells from the inside.<br>
<br>
Rune of Immunity can only be dispelled by Pierce Shield or Spell Strike.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Arcane Knowledge: Abjuration, or Abjurer, or Sorcerer (Celestial Bloodline).<br>

Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Shadowcloak swathes the caster in a powerful and persistent illusion. The effect resembles a combination of the wizard spells Improved Invisibility and Non-Detection, except that it is automatically reapplied to the caster, once per round, for the duration of the spell.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Arcane Knowledge: Illusion, or Illusionist, or Sorcerer (Shadowed Bloodline).<br>

<p><h3><a id="CA#SPWO" name="CA#SPWO"></a>Spell Worm (Enchantment/Charm)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual sight of caster<br>
Duration: 5 Turns<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This high level spell infects the subject with progressive forgetfulness. On a failed save, every round the subject loses his highest-level spell or spell slot. Each subsequent round the subject loses another spell or spell slot, moving to lower level spells once all the higher level spells are gone. In the first round the target is allowed a saving throw vs. spells at a -4 penalty. Every round thereafter there is a chance that the affected victim will lose a spell from the repertoire. The chance of this spell loss is reduced every 5th round by 5% (e.g. the target has 100% chance to lose a spell every round in the first five rounds, and only 75% in the 26-30th rounds). While fighting the effects of a Spell Worm, the caster has a 25% greater chance of spell failure every time he attempts to cast a spell, unless a successful save vs. spell (at -4) is made in the first round. Even if the save is successful however, the mental distraction causes the affected creature to fail every spellcasting attempt for 2 rounds. The spell's effects last for 5 turns.<br>

This spell opens a gate to the lower planes and calls forth a powerful fiend that is bound to serve by the caster's side until the spell expires or the fiend is slain. The fiend summoned is an ultroloth, one of the most powerful - and mysterious - of the scheming yugoloths, called forth from its planar fortress on the plane of Gehenna. Why this enigmatic creature consents to be called to the Prime Material Plane is not entirely clear, even to the caster.<br>

<p><h3><a id="DW-HLEPW" name="DW-HLEPW"></a>Summon Water Elemental Prince (Conjuration/Summoning)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 0<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
A spellcaster with a supremely powerful link to elemental water can call one of the Elemental Princes themselves. These powerful beings have normally stayed aloof from the events of the Prime Material Plane, but the epochal events now unfolding in Faerun seem to have drawn their attention.<br>
<br>
The Elemental Prince called depends on the caster's alignment. Good or Neutral casters will call Ben Hadar, Prince of Good Water Creatures. Evil casters instead call Olhydra, Princess of Evil Water Creatures.<br>
<br>
The Elemental Prince will stay for 1 turn and will consent to obey the caster as long as they remain summoned. Note that the elemental princes are unique beings - if one has already been called to Faerun and is present, your call will go unanswered.<br>

<p><h3><a id="DW-HLTDO" name="DW-HLTDO"></a>True Dominion (Enchantment/Charm)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual range of caster<br>

<br>
True Dominion is the ultimate mental control spell. It enables the caster to control the actions of a single target through a telepathic link. The power of the spell is such that there is no saving throw against its effects, and magic resistance is useless against it; however, magical items that protect against charm and domination also protect against True Dominion, and certain sorts of creatures - notably demons, dragons and the undead - are unaffected by any form of charm or domination magic.<br>

<p><h3><a id="DW-ELSWW" name="DW-ELSWW"></a>Water Elemental Swarm (Conjuration/Summoning)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 30 ft.<br>

<br>
This spell opens a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water and calls forth water elementals to serve the caster. Upon casting the spell, two 12-HD elementals immediately appear. One round later, a 16-HD elemental appears. One round later still, a 24-HD elemental appears. The elementals serve the caster faithfully, and disappear after 2 turns if they are not destroyed before then.<br>

<p><h3><a id="TG#WILD" name="TG#WILD"></a>Wildstrike (Conjuration/Summoning)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 30 yards<br>
Duration: 2 turns<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Neg.<br>
<br>
This spell is used primarily against hostile spellcasters. It distorts all attempts at spell casting, converting spell energy into wild surges. <br>
<br>
The victim of a wildstrike is allowed a saving throw vs. spells at a -2 penalty: even if the save is successful, the spell has some effect and the target becomes a subject of wild magic for the following 2 rounds (when the victim casts a spell or uses a charge from a magical item, a wild surge is automatically created). <br>
If the saving throw is failed, the target is enclosed within a deadlier field of wild magic: the effect lasts 2 turns. In addition, when determining the effects of this surge, the true level of the caster is subtracted from the die roll, making the effects of the wild surge more likely to harm the victim. <br>
<br>
Magic Resistance has no effect on this spell.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Wild Mage.</p></div>
