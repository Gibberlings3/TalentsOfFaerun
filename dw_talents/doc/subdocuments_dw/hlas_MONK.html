<p><h3><a id="TG#CHNT" name="TG#CHNT"></a>Chant </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability gives the Monk powerful physical protections for a very short time. It increases Slashing, Piercing, Crushing and Missile resistances to 75%, and increases Fire, Cold, and Lightning resistances by 25%. There is a price for such protection however: by focusing ki-energies against physical attacks, the monkâ€™s innate magic resistance will be nullified until this state expires. The effects of this ability last for 3 rounds. Multiple Chants are not cumulative.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Diamond Soul.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#DIAM" name="TG#DIAM"></a>Diamond Soul </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The monk is able to tune his/her body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that he/she becomes a magical creature. When he/she achieves a state of unshakeable stability in body and soul, <br>
he/she is no longer affected by spells and other abilities that would endanger this unity or attempt to manipulate his/her physical form.<br>
<br>
Diamond Soul renders the monk immune to effects like Petrification, Disintegration or Polymorph.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#DISP" name="TG#DISP"></a>Displacement </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>After becoming a partially ethereal creature, the monk can develop the ability to use this power instinctively in dangerous situations. When seriously injured he/she connects with the ethereal world, slipping his/her body out of phase with reality. When his/her hit points fall below 20% of their maximum the monk partially fades out, which grants him/her +2 AC and immunity to weapons with less than +3 enchantment level for 5 rounds. While in this state, the monk can still be seen by those around him/her and can be targeted by spells and magical effects. The effect can trigger only once in an 8-hour period.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Ethereal.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#BL03" name="TG#BL03"></a>Dragon Fist </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>High level Monks have the ability to focus Ki energies in their bodies in many ways. When using this ability all attacks made by the Monk in the next round will remove one Specific Protection up to 8th level (save vs. breath at -2), one Magical Protection up to 8th level (no save), and one Physical Protection up to 8th level (save vs breath). Creatures hit by Dragon Fist must also save vs. breath at -4, or their Magic Resistance will be reduced by 19% for 6 rounds. This effect is cumulative. Dragon Fist always removes the strongest Protection spell from the target.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Shadowless Kick.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#ETHE" name="TG#ETHE"></a>Ethereal </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>As a magical being, the high-level monk can assume an ethereal state for a limited time. For 5 rounds he/she becomes completely invisible to the eyes of others and receives a 4 point bonus to AC. In the first 2 rounds of this state he/she cannot be detected, not even by magical means, and the ethereal form grants him/her immunity to weapons below +4 enchantment level. If the monk makes an attack, creatures around him/her will know about his presence and he/she will become partially visible. During the ethereal state the monk cannot use any of his/her innate abilitie<br>
s.<br>
<br>
Note that powerful creatures - like Demons or Dragons - will still be able to see and attack the monk while ethereal.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Diamond Soul.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLAEV" name="DW-HLAEV"></a>Evasion </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability mirrors the thief's Evasion ability: when attacked by a spell that allows the character to make a saving throw for half damage, and when it is possible to dodge, fall flat, or otherwise nimbly evade the spell's effects, the character takes no damage (instead of half damage) on a successful save.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Barbarian or high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#FAST" name="TG#FAST"></a>Faster Than the Eye </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The monk can increase his/her movement speed to unbelievable heights for a single moment. During this time the monk is able to run to a point within sight in an instant, without being stopped or hurt by anyone.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#FINP" name="TG#FINP"></a>Finger of Destruction </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Evil monks can focus Ki energies in the most harmful ways. The Finger of Destruction is a secret and forbidden technique to most monks, and only those with no respect towards the lives of others are able to learn it.<br>
<br>
By concentrating his/her Ki into one point on the target's body, the monk touches an opponent with his/her pointing finger. If the attack is successful, the victim loses 5 points of Constitution and suffers a 2 point penalty to saves vs. death for 5 turns (no save). Creatures below 10 Hit Dice die immediately, and even those above this level suffer 10 points of magical damage.<br>
<br>
In addition to the instant effects, the destructive energies keep weakening the target, who will suffer an additional 1 point penalty to Constitution and saves vs. death every second round for 1 turn. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. death every time to avoid further negative effects.<br>
<br>
Finger of Destruction can only be used once per day.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Dragon Fist; may not be Good.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#INTI" name="TG#INTI"></a>Inner Time </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>is the pinnacle of the monk's mental and physical abilities. Having achieved perfect focus in body and soul, the most experienced monks are able to slow their inner time to a point where they sense every second as if it were five. This state allows them to judge combat situations more wisely and react to the surrounding world much more quickly and effectively. <br>
<br>
Inner Time not simply hastens the mind; the body becomes faster too. A spectator would find the monk's movement and actions incredibly fast. his/her fists become more dangerous than any other weapon: he/she gets 8 attacks/round, his/her damage, THAC0 and AC get a 4 points bonus, attack and casting speeds are also reduced by 2. he/she can catch missiles and throw them back to the attacker with the same move, and is protected from backstabs.<br>
<br>
The ability expires after 3 rounds, whereupon the monk will become winded and will be unable to use any special attacks or abilities for the following 2 rounds.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Faster Than the Eye.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#REGE" name="TG#REGE"></a>Regeneration </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Experienced monks can focus ki-energies in their bodies to regenerate themselves. The monk's regeneration rate will be increased by 2 hit points per round. This ability can be selected up to five times and its bonuses are cumulative with every other regeneration effect on the character.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Diamond Soul.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.<br>
<br>
<b>Special:</b> this ability may be selected up to 5 times. Its effects are cumulative.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLSFI" name="DW-HLSFI"></a>Searing Fists </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The monk's greater attunement to his/her ki increases the purity of his/her Flaming Fists power. It now inflicts 3d6 damage per hit.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Sun Soul Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#SECW" name="TG#SECW"></a>Second Wind </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>With many years of training and meditation and the purest of minds, untainted by the the slightest trace of evil, Monks can gain the ability to achieve a second wind. Second Wind grants the monk the ability to instantly heal his/her wounds when his/her Hit Points fall below 10% of their maximum. This ability can trigger only once per 8-hour period.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Regeneration; may not be Evil.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#BL09" name="TG#BL09"></a>Shadowless Kick </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This ability gives the Monk a one-time attack. This overwhelming assault is always successful; there is no need for an attack roll. The target suffers 5d8 crushing damage, and must save vs. breath at -4 or unconscious for 1 round and, unless sufficiently large, be knocked back a considerable distance by the power of the kick.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLSOI" name="DW-HLSOI"></a>Soul of Ice </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The monk's greater understanding of the teachings of Shar allows him/her to enhance the power of his/her Frozen Fist ability, and to maintain it permanently. It now inflicts 4 points of damage per hit and is always active.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Dark Moon Monk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#TIGS" name="TG#TIGS"></a>Tiger Strike </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>With this ability, the monk strikes a mighty blow, knocking an opponent back for a considerable distance and stunning that opponent for 1 round. All attacks made in the first round are at maximum damage. The ability lasts for 2 rounds. Large creatures such as dragons or giants will not be knocked back or stunned.<br>
