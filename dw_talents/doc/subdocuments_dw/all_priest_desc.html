<div class="ribbon_rectangle_h3"><h3><a name="42055" id="42055"></a>Auril (Icepriest)</h3></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-l"></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h3-r"></div>
<div class="section">
<p>Auril (pronounced: AWE-ril), also known as The Cold Goddess, The Frostmaiden, and the Goddess of Winter, is a fickle, vain, and evil deity. She is feared and worshipped in order to hold off the depradations of the harsh winters with which she threatens Faerûn. Trappers, miners, and settlers in the North, some barbarians and inhabitants of the Great Glacier, and residents of the lands crouching at any glacier's edge revere her and honor her in attempts to placate her cold fury come winter time.</p>

<p>Clergy of Auril seek to make all folk fear their goddess and her priests through the fury of the winter weather. They also try to make themselves personally wealthy and influential by carrying out tasks that others cannot in the worst winter weather and by magically protecting those who pay or obey from the worst winter conditions.</p>

<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>May learn priest spells from these spheres: Air, All, Divination, Divine, Earth, Evil, Healing, Necromantic, Protection, Summoning, Wards, Water.

<div class="spell_description">CONJURE ICE PARAELEMENTAL: The caster opens a special gate to the Paraelemental Plane of Ice and calls forth a powerful ice paraelemental bound to the service of Auril. The strength of the paraelemental depends on the power of the caster: initially, an 8-HD paraelemental is summoned, but this increases to 12HD at 13th level, to 16HD at 17th level, and to a maximum of 24HD at 21st level. The paraelemental will obey the commands of the priest, but the priest does not have to concentrate on it to control it, leaving him/her free to perform other actions while the ice paraelemental turns its enemies to frozen shards. The paraelemental will last until the spell duration expires or the paraelemental is slain.

<p>Azuth (pronounced: Ah-ZOOTH) is the god of wizards and mages and to a much lesser degree, all spellcasters, as opposed to Mystra, who is the goddess of all magic. Azuth is Mystra's servant, friend, and advisor.</p>

<p>Followers of Azuth feel that reason is the best way to approach magic, and that it may be examined and reduced to its component parts through study and meditation. Calm and caution are the watchwords of Azuthan clergy members as they strive to avoid mistakes that even magic cannot undo. They are taught to use Art (magic) wisely and to be always mindful of when it is best not to use magic.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>The leader of the elven pantheon, Corellon Larethian (pronounced: CORE-ehlon Lah-RETH-ee-yen) is said to have given birth to the entire elven race, although sometimes Sehanine or Angharradh are given credit as well. Elven lore states that the Fair Folk sprang from drops of blood Corellon shed in epic battles with Gruumsh mingled with Sehanine's (or Angharradh's) tears. The Creator of the Elves embodies the highest ideals of elvenkind, and he is the patron of most aesthetic endeavors, including art, magic, music, poetry, and warfare. He is venerated by all the Fair Folk, except the drow and those who have turned to Lolth, Ghaunadaur, Vhaeraun, and other dark powers. Corellon is especially popular with elf and half-elf mages, musicians, and poets.</p>

<p>Ceremonial vestments for priests of Corellon consist of azure robes made of gossamer and embroidered with silver quarter moons. Silver circlets engraved with the Protector's symbol are worn on the brow. The holy symbol of the faith is a silver or mithral lunate pendant worn on a slender chain hung from the neck. When adventuring, Corellon's priests generally favor traditionally elven equipment in conscious imitation of their divine patron.</p>

<p>Gruumsh (pronounced: GROOMSH) is the undisputed head of the pantheon of the orcs. He is a fearsome, brutal god who revels in warface, and ever seeks new territory for his race.

It is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, oppressed, or in great need. He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed and unjustly treated. </p>

<p>The followers of Ilmater are often perceived as being intentional sufferers, but in reality they offer a great deal along the "pure clerical" nature of healing and recovery to those who have been hurt. They put others ahead of themselves, are sharing, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the gross material body. Ilmater's priests are found where they are needed, which is usually in the worst possible conditions, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, and the poor. They dress simply in gray, with gray skullcaps (blood red for the higher ranks).</p>

<div class="section">
<p>Kossuth (pronounced: Koh-SOOTH), Firelord, the Tyrant among Fire, is an Elemental Lord from the Elemental Plane of Fire. He is generally uncaring to his faithful, but continues to grant his priests their powers since their worship increases his power on his home plane. To maintain continued worship he does take a limited interest in his followers' mortal problems, and occasionally makes his presence known with a manifestation, but never an avatar.</p>

<p>Kossuth's church is varied and chaotic since he takes no interest in its structure. As a result it is a collection of cults with each faction coming up with its own ethics, codes, morals, and teachings. Kossuth's symbol varies greatly from faction to faction, but is generally a depiction of fire. It is believed that if Kossuth's following were to somehow become unified he would become a very powerful force in the Realms, something the other gods don't really wish to see happen. Of the four Elemental Lords, the best known and most feared are the cults of Kossuth, who are very powerful in Thay and the lands of the East.</p>

<p>Firewalkers of Kossuth can be of any alignment, but most are evil, reveling in the destructive power of fire. They can be members of any race. They dress in whatever their faction deems appropriate for the representation of their god. This is usually robes and long capes in reds, yellows, and oranges.</p>

<p>Mystra (pronounced: MISS-trah) is the goddess of magic and with that the goddess of possibilities, which makes her arguably the most powerful deity in Faerûn. She is said to have taught the first spellcaster of the Realms, and to have enabled many of the races to use magic. She supposedly weighs and judges each new spell or magical item to determine whether it should be permitted into the Realms. She is most venerated by wizards and those who use magic or magical items in their daily use. She differs from Azuth in that Azuth is the god of wizards (as to a much lesser degree, all spellcasters), while Mystra is the goddess of the essential force that makes all spellcasting possible. She provides and tends the Weave, the conduit to enable mortal spellcasters and magical crafters to safely access the raw force that is magic.</p>

<p>Mystra's priests work hard to preserve all magical lore in secret libraries, private safeholds, well-guarded research laboratories, and small, hidden stashes so that magic flourishes in the future regardless of what befalls the thinking races of Faerûn or the powers of the planes. Mystrans also search out beings skilled in spell use, seeking to keep watch on the identities, powers, and behavior of individuals likely to become magic wielders of importance.</p>

They seek to build harmony among lycanthropes and non-shapechangers, and they protect the weak and the oppressed everywhere. They cannot abide slavery, and they hate most undead. They rarely settle in one place for long, instead moving along when seized by wanderlust or enticed by a new cause or mission.

She has a large number of shrines in coastal cities, and sailors often leave flowers, candles, small candies, or coins on her altars in hopes that Umberlee will spare them on the next voyage. Others who pay tribute to her include merchants sending goods by sea, port cities, and island nations and settlements who would be devastated by her wrath and have not a powerful patron deity to counter her menacing demands.</p>
