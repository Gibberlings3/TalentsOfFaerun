<p><p>Most High-Level Abilities available to druids are quest-level spells, which are listed <a href="hlas_questlevel.html">here</a>. However, this page lists the comparatively-few abilities available to high-level druids which are not quest spells.</p><p>Note that this list assumes a full install of Talents of Faerun, excluding the 'new low-level abilities' component. If you have a partial install, your High-Level Ability system may differ from the one documented here in small ways.</p></p>
