Range: Sight<br>
Duration: 4 rounds/level<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>
Area of Effect: single target<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell outlines its target with a pale violet glow, making positions and movements easily visible. Outlined creatures are easier to strike, giving them an Armor Class penalty of -2. Faerie Fire has no effect in full daylight.</p></div>

Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Creature touched<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by good or good-enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of - 2 to each attack roll, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR1A2" name="SPPR1A2"></a>Strength of Stone (Evocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Sphere: Elemental (earth)<br>
Range: 0<br>
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell channels elemental power into the caster, granting him/her a +4 bonus to strength. As long as the spell remains active, however, the caster's speed is reduced by 50%.</p></div>

Range: Touch<br>
Duration: 1 round/level<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: Creature touched<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell provides a subject with a better resistance to acid, corrosives, and caustic substances of all kinds, such as black dragon breath, Melfâ€™s acid arrow, and the natural attacks of various puddings, oozes, slimes, and jellies. Such substances inflict only half the normal damage on the protected character.</p></div>

<p><h3><a id="SPPR4A0" name="SPPR4A0"></a>Protection From Good 10' Radius (Abjuration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Protection<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Duration: 1 turn/level<br>
Casting Time: 7<br>
Area of Effect: 10' radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When this spell is cast, all creatures within a 10' radius are affected individually by 'protection from good'.  It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by good or good-enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of - 2 to each attack roll, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.</p></div>
</div><div class="ribbon_rectangle_h2"><h2><a name="LEVEL7" id="LEVEL7"></a>New Level 7 Spells</h2></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>

<p><h3><a id="SPPR7A0" name="SPPR7A0"></a>Fiendish Warding (Abjuration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Protection<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Duration: 3 rounds/level<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total number of spell levels equal to half the level of the caster. It includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest and area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.<br>
<br>
As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.<br>
<br>
This spell will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but it will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.<br>
This spell may only be cast by evil characters.</p></div>
