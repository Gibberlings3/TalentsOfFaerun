<div class="section">
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLBAB" name="DW-HLBAB"></a>Abyssal Pact </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The blackguard has come to an arrangement with a mighty demon lord; in exchange for present and future favors too hideous to contemplate, the blackguard may use the demon lord's patronage to command the service of a marilith, glabrezu, nabassu or other demon once per day. Demons are capricious and it can never be guaranteed which demons will respect the pact, but in general only Balors and demon lords will dare to refuse the blackguard's command, though the demon will remain at the blackguard's side for only a single turn before departing.<br>
<br>
The blackguard takes a terrible risk in making the pact. Each time he/she uses this ability, he/she has a 10% chance of forfeiting his/her soul to his/her patron. If this happens, the blackguard will not be able to be resurrected after his/her death: he/she will be forever lost.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Blood War Secrets; may not be Lawful.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Blackguard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="TG#ACRO" name="TG#ACRO"></a>Acrobatics </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Swashbucklers are known as great fighters, but their training concentrates more on movement and agility instead of pure strength and devastating blows.

Area of Effect: Creature Touched<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This is an improved version of the mage spell Iron Body; it turns the target creature's body into living adamantite. <br>
<br>
The new metallic body has many advantages: it reduces AC by 5, grants complete immunity to elemental and poison based attacks, and offers 90% resistance to magical and physical attacks. The target's Magic Damage Resistance is also set to 25%. In addition, the adamantite body can only be harmed by +3 weapons or better. While the new form doesn't allow the use of<br>
weapons, the hands will be more than capable for battle - they both act as +4 weapons, deal 4d6 points of damage and are used with grandmaster level of proficiency. However, the target's casting time is increased by 4 as long as the spell lasts.<br>

Duration: Permanent<br>
Casting Time: 8<br>
Area of Effect: 1 Creature<br>
Saving Throw: Neg.<br>
<br>
By casting this terrible spell, the caster attempts to magically destroy the target creature's body and turn it into a Flesh Golem, controlled by the caster. The target must make a save vs. polymorph to avoid instant death and transformation, but even if the save is successful, it will suffer 3d6 +3 points of damage because of the physical shock. Creatures of 12th level or below receive no saving throw. The newly created Flesh Golem will obey every command of the Transmuter.<br>
<br>
Normally golems are created in a long and arduous process. The magical bonds in their bodies require tremendous amounts of time and enchantments to be made permanent. The hastened method of this spell's transformation has its drawbacks naturally: any Flesh Golems created by this spell will decay into nothing after 1 hour.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Arcane Knowledge: Alteration, or Transmuter, or Sorcerer (Deepearth Bloodline).<br>

<b>Requirements:</b> able to cast ninth-level arcane spells.<br>

At high levels (25+) the caster is able to create an Apocalyptic Boneguard, a very fearsome ally.

Greater Boneguards exist for 10 turns and Apocalyptic Boneguards exist for 7 turns.<br>

During the round when this ability is activated, every attack of the thief deals maximum damage and may weaken his/her target.

By means of this spell necromancers can increase the power of their undead servants.

<p><h3><a id="DW-HLDBI" name="DW-HLDBI"></a>Demon Binding </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Through perusal of forbidden texts and conversations of a questionable nature, the character has learned some of the secrets of the fiends of the lower planes, and - through dark pacts, fragments of true names, and raw power - can exercise a modicum of control over some of them. When using the mage spells Summon Fiend and Cacofiend to bring forth a fiend, the character will bind the fiend called forth to obey his/her will, instead of simply leaving it to rampage at random.<br>
<br>
Most wizards avoid demon binding for good reason: he/she who trafficks with fiends puts his/her immortal soul at risk. Each time the character summons and binds a fiend, there is a 10% chance that his/her alignment will shift one step towards evil. If he/she is already evil, there is instead a 10% chance that his/her soul will be forfeit to the denizens of the lower planes. A character whose soul is lost in this way cannot be resurrected from the dead - once slain, he/she is forever lost.<br>
<br>
This ability may be taken twice. When taken a second time, the character gains the ability to bind even the mighty fiends called forth by the Gate spell. When doing so, the risk of the character sliding towards evil, or of forfeiting his/her soul, increases to 25%.<br>

By softly humming a subtly hypnotic tune, an experienced Bard can captivate and enthrall any audience, even creatures that do not understand his/her language. Opponents in the area of effect must successfully save vs. paralyzation or give the Bard their undivided attention, totally ignoring their surroundings and becoming fascinated for the following five rounds.

The contracts of the Hells are so byzantine that it can never be guaranteed which baatezu will be bound by the contract, but in general only the mighty Pit Fiends - and baatezu of similar power - are unconstrained by it; other baatezu must obey without question, though the length of their service is only one turn and they will depart immediately afterwards.<br>
<br>

This devastating spell was created by a powerful drow wizard named Malavon, somewhere deep within The Spine of the World. This is the improved version of his spell Malavon's Rage. The caster causes dozens of magical acid darts to strike anyone within a 30' radius. Every creature caught in the area of effect suffers 15D8 points of acid damage (save vs. breath for half).

Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
An experienced Bard eventually learns to influence the actions of his/her opponents. By focusing his/her willpower a Bard can suggest a course of activity which opponents feel strongly compelled to follow. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out and break the enchantment. If a common language is shared, the Bard can generally force the subjects to perform as he/she desires, within the limits of their abilities. If no common language is shared, the character can communicate only by using basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," "Stand still" etc. Opponents can attempt a saving throw vs. spells in order to avoid being controlled, but even if they succeed, there is still a 25% chance that they will suffer a mental breakdown from the amount of stress that their minds have suffered. This will effectively cause them to enter a Berserk state (no save) and attack the nearest creature for one round.<br>
<br>
This ability completely ignores any magic resistance of the targets. However, it has no effect on undead, or on mindless creatures such as constructs and slimes. The racial charm resistance of Elves and Half-Elves also applies.<br>

When invoked, this spell enrages the land, so it will attempt to destroy all living and non-living creatures in its area of effect. Every creature takes 1d10 points of Poison and 1d10 points of Acid damage each round it is exposed to the deadly vapors. If someone fails a saving throw vs. poison at -2, they become poisoned. Another failed save vs. poison results in disease, and the victim will lose one point of Constitution for 5 rounds. This spell banishes and destroys all summoned creatures. Besides its destructive powers, Nature's Wrath has a more vicious characteristic: it attempts to stop creatures from escaping its area or at least slow them. Any target must save vs. spells at -4, or becomes entangled for a short time. Entangled creatures can still attack.<br>

Duration: 5 Turns<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This high level spell infects the subject with progressive forgetfulness. On a failed save, every round the subject loses his highest-level spell or spell slot. Each subsequent round the subject loses another spell or spell slot, moving to lower level spells once all the higher level spells are gone. In the first round the target is allowed a saving throw vs. spells at a -4 penalty. Every round thereafter there is a chance that the affected victim will lose a spell from the repertoire. The chance of this spell loss is reduced every 5th round by 5% (e.g. the target has 100% chance to lose a spell every round in the first five rounds, and only 75% in the 26-30th rounds). While fighting the effects of a Spell Worm, the caster has a 25% greater chance of spell failure every time he attempts to cast a spell, unless a successful save vs. spell (at -4) is made in the first round. Even if the save is successful however, the mental distraction causes the affected creature to fail every spellcasting attempt for 2 rounds. The spell's effects last for 5 turns.<br>

Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Neg.<br>
<br>
This spell is used primarily against hostile spellcasters. It distorts all attempts at spell casting, converting spell energy into wild surges. <br>
<br>
The victim of a wildstrike is allowed a saving throw vs. spells at a -2 penalty: even if the save is successful, the spell has some effect and the target becomes a subject of wild magic for the following 2 rounds (when the victim casts a spell or uses a charge from a magical item, a wild surge is automatically created). <br>
If the saving throw is failed, the target is enclosed within a deadlier field of wild magic: the effect lasts 2 turns. In addition, when determining the effects of this surge, the true level of the caster is subtracted from the die roll, making the effects of the wild surge more likely to harm the victim. <br>
<br>
Magic Resistance has no effect on this spell.<br>
