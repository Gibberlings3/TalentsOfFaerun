By softly humming a subtly hypnotic tune, an experienced Bard can captivate and enthrall any audience, even creatures that do not understand his/her language. Opponents in the area of effect must successfully save vs. paralyzation or give the Bard their undivided attention, totally ignoring their surroundings and becoming fascinated for the following five rounds. Fascinated creatures can take no actions for the duration of the effect; however, they can still perceive danger on a subconscious level, so any hostile action taken against them automatically breaks this state. In addition, even if opponents make their saving throws and avoid the fascination effect, there is still a 25% chance that they will become confused for one round (no save) from being too deeply immersed into the hypnotic pattern of the song.<br>
<br>
This ability completely ignores any magic resistance of the targets. However, it has no effect on mindless creatures such as Constructs, Skeletons, Zombies and Slimes.<br>

Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 30-feet radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
An experienced Bard eventually learns to influence the actions of his/her opponents. By focusing his/her willpower a Bard can suggest a course of activity which opponents feel strongly compelled to follow. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out and break the enchantment. If a common language is shared, the Bard can generally force the subjects to perform as he/she desires, within the limits of their abilities. If no common language is shared, the character can communicate only by using basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," "Stand still" etc. Opponents can attempt a saving throw vs. spells in order to avoid being controlled, but even if they succeed, there is still a 25% chance that they will suffer a mental breakdown from the amount of stress that their minds have suffered. This will effectively cause them to enter a Berserk state (no save) and attack the nearest creature for one round.<br>
<br>
This ability completely ignores any magic resistance of the targets. However, it has no effect on undead, or on mindless creatures such as constructs and slimes. The racial charm resistance of Elves and Half-Elves also applies.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL906" name="SPCL906"></a>Power Attack </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>A Power Attack allows the warrior to strike blows so forceful that they stun an opponent for 2 rounds if the opponent fails a Save vs. Death at a -4 penalty. The ability lasts for 2 rounds.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter, high level Paladin, high level Ranger, or high level Skald.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="RR#BHL05" name="RR#BHL05"></a>Resonating Weapon </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Bards eventually achieve a high degree of control over sound which enables them to imbue any weapon with concentrated sound energy for a short while. A weapon imbued in this fashion resonates with a sharp tone and deals an extra 2d4 points of sonic damage to its target on each hit. Furthermore, anyone struck by the resonating weapon must save vs. breath or become temporarily deafened. After 4 rounds have passed, the weapon ceases to resonate and the deafness subsides.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="DW-HLSLP" name="DW-HLSLP"></a>Slippery Mind </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>This rogue can occasionally manage to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel him/her. The first time he/she fails a saving throw against charm, domination, or similar magic, he/she is nonetheless unaffected. This ability can function at most once per hour.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bard or high level Thief.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="RR#BHL06" name="RR#BHL06"></a>Sound Barrier </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The most skilled of all Bards are able to fully control the intensity, speed, and direction of the very waves which compose sound, which allows them to shape and bend it as they see fit. By utilizing this ability, the Bard encases him/herself within a sphere of swirling sound waves thereby forming a barrier which protects him/her from all sound-based spells and attacks, such as Silence, Deafness, Power Words, Holy Word, the howl of the demilich, and the wail of the banshee. Anyone who attempts to break through the barrier and strike the Bard in melee takes 2d8 points of sonic damage. Furthermore, the attacker may become deafened (75% chance) or stunned (25% chance) during the following round unless a save vs. breath is made. The sound barrier dissipates after 5 rounds.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Resonating Weapon.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="RR#BHL03" name="RR#BHL03"></a>Sound Burst </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 30-feet radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
The Bard magically amplifies the capabilities of a musical instrument in order to fill his/her surroundings with high-pitched, stone-shattering sound waves. Creatures in the nearby area take 15d6 points of sonic damage and are also deafened for five rounds. Deafened creatures suffer a 50% chance of spellcasting failure. A successful save vs. breath halves the damage and negates the deafness.<br>
<br>
This ability completely ignores any magic resistance of the targets. However, resistance to energy damage can reduce the amount of damage dealt.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bard.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL915" name="SPCL915"></a>Use Any Item </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Rogues take pride in their ability to adapt and make clever use of whatever is at hand. This ability is an extension of that basic skill. Once learned, the effect is permanent. The ability allows the rogue to use any item, even items that are typically restricted to one class. This allows the rogue to use everything from wands and scrolls to mighty weapons that none but a warrior could otherwise use.<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Use Wands.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Bard or high level Thief.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPCL908" name="SPCL908"></a>War Cry </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>With a War Cry, the warrior emits a powerful and frightening yell that will panic all opponents in a 15-ft. radius if they don't make their Save vs. Spell.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Fighter or high level Skald.</p></div>
