<p><p>Most High-Level Abilities available to shamans are quest-level spells, which are listed <a href="hlas_questlevel.html">here</a>. However, this page lists the comparatively-few abilities available to high-level shamans which are not quest spells.</p><p>Note that this list assumes a full install of Talents of Faerun, excluding the 'new low-level abilities' component. If you have a partial install, your High-Level Ability system may differ from the one documented here in small ways.</p></p>

<p><h3><a id="DWHPT2" name="DWHPT2"></a>Create Clerical Potions </h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>The character's rapport with the divine has reached the stage where they can imbue water with a small part of that divine power, creating potions of healing and protection. Brewing potions requires the expenditure of gold on the raw materials (equal to the cost of buying the potion in a store) and draws slightly on the character's life force (equivalent to a loss of 1 experience point per gold piece cost).<br>
<br>
The character may brew the following potions:<br>
Antidote<br>
Elixir of Health<br>
Potion of Clarity<br>
Potion of Extra Healing<br>
Potion of Freedom<br>
Potion of Healing<br>
Potion of Regeneration<br>
Potion of Superior Healing<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Cleric, high level Druid, high level Favored Soul, or high level Shaman.</p></div>

<br>
This powerful rite shields the Shaman from death for 1 hour or until discharged. While under the protection of this rite, the Shaman is immune to all forms of death magic. In addition, if the Shaman is reduced below 10% Hit Points and the rite is active, the Shaman instantly receives the benefit of a Heal spell. The rite's protection (including the immunity to death) is completely discharged once the Heal spell is triggered.<br>
<br>
Requires: Spirit Form<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Shaman.</p></div>

Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
The shaman slips into a space between the spirit world and the material plane, rendering them partially incorporeal. For the next 5 rounds, all physical attacks directed against the shaman deal 50% of their normal damage. During this time, the shaman is also under the effects of Improved Invisibility and cannot be directly targeted by spells.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> high level Shaman.</p></div>
