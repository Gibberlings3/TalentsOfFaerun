<p><p>Most High-Level Abilities available to clerics are quest-level spells, which are listed <a href="hlas_questlevel.html">here</a>. However, this page lists the comparatively-few abilities available to high-level clerics which are not quest level spells.</p><p>Note that this list assumes a full install of Talents of Faerun, excluding the 'new low-level abilities' component. If you have a partial install, your High-Level Ability system may differ from the one documented here in small ways.</p></p>

Brewing potions requires the expenditure of gold on the raw materials (equal to the cost of buying the potion in a store) and draws slightly on the character's life force (equivalent to a loss of 1 experience point per gold piece cost).<br>
<br>
The character may brew the following potions:<br>
Antidote<br>
Elixir of Health<br>
Potion of Clarity<br>
Potion of Extra Healing<br>
Potion of Freedom<br>
Potion of Healing<br>
Potion of Regeneration<br>
Potion of Superior Healing<br>

This passive ability causes the priest to be shielded by these spells upon being reduced to 50% of his/her maximum hit points: Sanctuary, Shield of the Archons, and Physical Mirror. This power can operate at most once per 8-hour period.<br>
<br>
