When invoked, this spell enrages the land, so it will attempt to destroy all living and non-living creatures in its area of effect. Every creature takes 1d10 points of Poison and 1d10 points of Acid damage each round it is exposed to the deadly vapors. If someone fails a saving throw vs. poison at -2, they become poisoned. Another failed save vs. poison results in disease, and the victim will lose one point of Constitution for 5 rounds. This spell banishes and destroys all summoned creatures. Besides its destructive powers, Nature's Wrath has a more vicious characteristic: it attempts to stop creatures from escaping its area or at least slow them. Any target must save vs. spells at -4, or becomes entangled for a short time. Entangled creatures can still attack.<br>

This spell opens a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water and calls forth water elementals to serve the caster. Upon casting the spell, two 12-HD elementals immediately appear. One round later, a 16-HD elemental appears. One round later still, a 24-HD elemental appears. The elementals serve the caster faithfully, and disappear after 2 turns if they are not destroyed before then.<br>
