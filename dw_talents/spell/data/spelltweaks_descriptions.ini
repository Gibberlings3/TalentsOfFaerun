[rebalance]
name="Rebalancings of slightly-too-powerful spells"
shortname="Rebalanced spells"
description="<p>Tweaks in this section rebalance various slightly too-powerful spells. The enemy AI in Sword Coast Stratagems will sometimes behave a little oddly if this component is not installed.</p>"

[boost]
name="Spells increased in power"
shortname="Increased power"
description="<p>Tweaks in this section somewhat increase the power of various spells which (in my subjective judgement) were a little under-powered compared to similar spells at the same level.</p>"

[core-scs]
name="Core Stratagems spell-system changes"
shortname="Stratagems core"
description="<p>These tweaks alter a range of spells, mostly but not entirely focussed around a spellcaster's defenses and abilities to remove other creatures' defenses. What unites them is that all are assumed by the enemy AI in Sword Coast Stratagems, and enemy spellcasters may act quite strangely from time to time if this is not installed.</p>"

[scroll]
name="Scroll availability"
description="<p>These tweaks make various spell scrolls more widely available.</p>"

[restoration]
name="Changes to Restoration"
shortname="Restoration"
description="Tweaks in this section alter the Restoration and Lesser Restoration spells."

[school]
name="Spell school changes"
shortname="School changes"
description="Tweaks in this section alter the schools of certain mage spells."

[iwd]
name="Icewind Dale-inspired tweaks to Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate II spells"
shortname="IWD tweaks to BG"
description="Tweaks in this section alter Baldur's Gate / Baldur's Gate II spells to more closely match how they work in Icewind Dale. In most cases this slightly increases the power of the spell. The effects are for the most part self-explanatory."

[bg]
name="Baldur's Gate-inspired tweaks to Icewind Dale spells"
shortname="BG tweaks to IWD"
description="Tweaks in this section alter Icewind Dale spells to more closely match how they work in Baldur's Gate / Baldur's Gate II. In most cases this slightly increases the power of the spell. The effects are for the most part self-explanatory."

[shapeshift]
name="Changes to shapeshift spells"
shortname="Shapeshift changes"
description="Tweaks in this section alter shapeshift spells, making them more flexible and somewhat more powerful."

[web_and_the_large]
name="Grant large, amorphous, solid, or similar creatures immunity to Web and Entangle"
description="Logically, things like Fire Elementals, Grey Oozes, and Giants ought to be unaffected by Web and Entangle effects. This component grants them immunity to those effects. Affected creatures are elementals, slimes, incorporeal creatures, any sufficiently large creature, and (on Enhanced Edition only) any creature shrouded in magical fire."
WIZARD_WEB="Web does not affect very large creatures like giants or dragons (which brush the webs aside), incorporeal creatures like shadows or wraiths (which pass through them), amorphous creatures like slimes or elementals (which flow around them), or creatures shrouded in magical fire (which burn them away in their vicinity)."
CLERIC_ENTANGLE="Entangle does not affect very large creatures like giants or dragons (which brush the entwining plants aside), incorporeal creatures like shadows or wraiths (which pass through them), amorphous creatures like slimes or elementals (which flow around them), or creatures shrouded in magical fire (which burn them away in their vicinity)."

[acid_storm_tonedown]
name="Rebalance Acid Storm"
description="The seventh-level spell Acid Storm inflicts a small amount of damage once per round, with no saving throw, on all in its area of effect for one round per level. The damage itself from the spell is minor, but this is an absolutely devastating way to shut down spellcasting.

This (somewhat experimental) rebalancing makes Acid Storm more like an area-effect version of Vitriolic Sphere, inflicting more damage but for a shorter time."
WIZARD_ACID_STORM="The victim initially suffers 10d6 points of acid damage. After the initial damage, the victim must save vs. Spell to avoid more damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two fewer dice of damage each round: that is, 8d6 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d6 on the second round, 4d6 on the third round, 2d6 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Moving out of the area of effect does not stop the damage."

[antimagic_penetrates_ii]
name="Antimagic attacks penetrate Improved Invisibility"
description="This component changes those spells which target a creature's spell defences (e.g. Secret Word, Spellstrike, Ruby Ray of Reversal - but not Breach) so as to allow them to target creatures which are protected by Improved Invisibility. The idea of this component is that these spells can now be cast on enemy mages who are protected by Improved Invisibility - this makes the Improved Invisibility / Spell Immunity: Divination combination less overpowering.</p>
<p>This functionality is actually in the Enhanced Edition games already, but is undocumented. On the Enhanced Edition, all this component does is add documentation."
PIERCE_SHIELD,SPELL_STRIKE,RUBY_RAY_OF_REVERSAL,WARDING_WHIP,PIERCE_MAGIC,SPELL_THRUST,SECRET_WORD="This spell may be used to remove magical protections even from creatures which could not normally be targetted by spells because they are invisible."

[bonus_spell_scrolls]
name="Add extra spell scrolls for hard-to-find spells"
description="This component adds one extra copy of a few spells into shops in Amn and Trademeet. The spells are chosen to be ones which otherwise tend only to be found late in the game or only given good luck with random loot.</p>
<p>
The affected spells are Bigby's Clenched Fist, Bigby's Crushing Hand, Control Undead, Improved Mantle, Invisibility 10' Radius, Mordenkainen's Sword, Pierce Shield, Remove Magic, Ruby Ray of Reversal, Spell Shield, Stone to Flesh, and Summon Nishruu. The location of the scrolls is determined randomly at install time."

[blade_barrier]
name="Blade Barrier and Globe of Blades only affect hostile creatures"
description="Even in the unmodded game, hostile priests used a special form of Blade Barrier that only affected their foes. (This is probably because, in the Infinity Engine, it is almost impossible to script creatures to avoid them crashing into each other.) This component (in the name of fairness, and also of hassle avoidance) extends this to the player's version of these two spells: with it installed, players and NPCs use the same form of Blade Barrier. (They don't quite use the old NPC version, which had a rather shorter range: they use a hybrid version, as large as the old PC version but affecting only enemies)."
BLADE_BARRIER,GLOBE_OF_BLADES="The blades only affect hostile creatures."

[npc_symbols]
name=Symbols only affect hostile creatures
description=Hostile spellcasters in the unmodded game use a special form of Symbol that only affects their foes. This component (for fairness and hassle avoidance) applies this to the player's version of all Symbol spells.
WIZARD_SYMBOL_FEAR,CLERIC_SYMBOL_FEAR,WIZARD_SYMBOL_PAIN,CLERIC_SYMBOL_PAIN,WIZARD_SYMBOL_HOPELESSNESS,CLERIC_SYMBOL_HOPELESSNESS,WIZARD_SYMBOL_STUN,CLERIC_SYMBOL_STUN,WIZARD_SYMBOL_DEATH,CLERIC_SYMBOL_DEATH="The symbol only affects hostile creatures."

[spell_immunity]
name=Allow players to use the individual versions of Spell Immunity in triggers
description=Spell Immunity is really eight sub-spells. This component allows a subspell to be placed into a Contingency or Spell Trigger. (This is already present on Enhanced Edition games.)

[fiend_summoning]
name="Alignment-appropriate fiends"
description="The fiend-summoning spells (Cacofiend, Summon Fiend, Gate) are a little inconsistent in the kinds of fiends they summon: Cacofiend and Summon Fiend summon chaotic evil tanar'ri (demons), Gate summons lawful evil baatezu (devils). This component causes the fiends that are summoned to be on the same point of the Law/Chaos axis as the caster: Lawful characters will summon Bone Fiends, Cornugons and Pit Fiends; Chaotic and Neutral characters will summon Nabassu, Glabrezu and Balors."
CACOFIEND="The fiend summoned depends on the caster's alignment: Lawful casters summon a Bone Fiend, Chaotic and Neutral casters summon a Nabassu."
SUMMON_FIEND="The fiend summoned depends on the caster's alignment: Lawful casters summon a Cornugon, Chaotic and Neutral casters summon a Glabrezu."
WIZARD_GATE,CLERIC_GATE="The fiend summoned depends on the caster's alignment: Lawful casters summon a Pit Fiend, Chaotic and Neutral casters summon a Balor."

[harm]
name="Modify the Harm spell so it does damage rather than reducing target hit points to 1"
description="The Harm spell reduces its target to 1 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> in 2nd edition <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym>; in 3rd edition, it does a large amount of damage instead. This component modifies Harm to work more like the 3rd edition spell: it inflicts 150 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> damage,    with no saving throw, on a successful touch attack, to a minimum of 1 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym>. The rationale for this    is that Harm (especially combined with Critical Strike) is otherwise an almost-instant    way of eliminating even foes with hundreds of hit points. Harm remains lethal    in this component, but is not quite so overwhelming."
HARM="The spell inflicts 150 hit points of damage, but leaves its target with at least 1 hit point."

[insect_plague]
name="Rebalance Insect Plague spells (and the like)"
description="In the unmodified game, Insect Plague and Creeping Doom (and, to a lesser extent, Summon Insects) are very hard indeed for a spellcaster to deal with or defend against. This component (which was partly inspired by Demivrgvs's Spell Revisions) handles the insects more systematically as summoned creatures: they inflict piercing damage; they cannot harm or affect creatures immune to nonmagical weapons; they are unaffected by antimagic or by Dispel Magic; they will not attack undead creatures, and cannot penetrate the extreme heat or cold of a Fire Shield."
INSECT_PLAGUE,CREEPING_DOOM,SUMMON_INSECTS="Insects act as summoned creatures: magic resistance or Dispel Magic do not affect them; they inflict piercing damage; they cannot affect creatures unaffected by nonmagical weapons; they will not attack undead; they cannot penetrate the extreme heat or cold of a Fire Shield."

[mantle]
name="Slightly increase the power of Mantle, Improved Mantle, and Absolute Immunity"
description="In the unmodded game, Mantle protects you from +2 or weaker weapons, Improved Mantle from +3 or weaker weapons, and Absolute Immunity from +5 or weaker weapons. In all cases, arguably this is slightly too weak given the prevalence of such weapons in the game. This component increases each protective range by one: Mantle protects against +3 or weaker weapons, Improved Mantle against +4 or weaker weapons, and Absolute Immunity against +6 or weaker weapons (i.e., basically everything.)"
MANTLE="The spell protects against weapons of +3 or lesser enchantment."
IMPROVED_MANTLE="The spell protects against weapons of +4 or lesser enchantment."
ABSOLUTE_IMMUNITY="The spell protects against weapons of +6 or lesser enchantment (i.e. essentially all weapons)."

[meteors]
name="Make Minute Meteors into +2 weapons"
description="In the unmodded game, the meteors created by the third-level Melf's Minute Meteors spell strike as +6 weapons, enough to penetrate any creature's resistances and to cut through even the (unmodded) Absolute Immunity spell. This strikes me as a bit overpowered for a third-level spell. This component makes meteors +2 - still enough to hit most creatures, but not enough to cut through any of the (Stratagems-modified) protection-from-magic-weapon spells."
MELF_METEOR="Meteors count as +2 weapons (rather than +6)."

[power_word_blind]
name="Make Power Word: Blind a single-target spell"
description=Unlike other Power Words, Power Word: Blind has a small area of effect. This both makes it rather powerful, and makes it virtually impossible for enemy <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> to use without "friendly-fire" incidents. This component just makes Power Word: Blind target a single creature.
POWER_WORD_BLIND="The spell targets a single creature only."

[modify_breach]
name="More consistent Breach spell (always affects liches and rakshasas;       doesn't penetrate Spell Turning)"
description=Although it isn't documented, the 5th level spell Breach will remove a creature's   combat protections (such as Stoneskin) even if that creature is protected     by Spell Deflection, Spell Turning or Spell Trap; it will not, however, affect   creatures like liches or rakshasas, because they are immune to spells of  level 5 or below. This component removes both features: Breach now bounces off Spell Turning (etc.), but it affects even those creatures immune to "normal" 5th level spells.</p> <p> Once this is installed, the Breach effect of the Wand of Spell Striking will behave in exactly the same way as the Breach spell.
BREACH="Breach affects creatures normally immune to fifth-level spells (like liches and rakshasas), and does not penetrate Spell Turning and the like."

[nature_beauty_blindness]
name="Nature's Beauty effects are not removed from hostile creatures by True Sight"
description="Nature's Beauty is an illusion spell, which means that its blinding effect is removed by enemy-cast True Sight spells. This is a bit counterintuitive and doesn't really fit with the concept of the spell. This tweak prevents the blindness effect from being removed by anti-illusion magic. (On Spell Revisions, this applies to the Charm effect instead.)"
NATURE_BEAUTY="Anti-illusion magic will not remove the blindness effect (or, on Spell Revisions installs, the Charm effect)."

[nerf_greater_restoration]
name="Revert Greater Restoration back to only affecting one creature"
description="Throne of Bhaal makes an undocumented (but widely known) modification to  the Greater Restoration spell, making it into an area-effect spell that heals  the entire party. This component reverts Greater Restoration to its <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> version (also its BG2EE version),  where only one creature can be affected."
RESTORATION="Restoration only affects one creature (this was the standard behavior anyway on Enhanced-Edition games)."

[pro_normal_missiles]
name="Make Protection from Normal Missiles affect some magical projectiles"
description="This component improves the power of the Protection from Normal Missiles  spell. It now blocks most magical  arrows, bolts etc that lack a formal "plus": that is, it blocks fire arrows, ice arrows and the like. The exceptions are the Arrows of Detonation, the Arrows  of Slaying, and the Arrows of Dispelling. This significantly increases the usefulness of the spell (read: makes it not entirely useless for NPC mages)."
PROTECTION_FROM_NORMAL_MISSILES="The spell blocks most magical  arrows, bolts etc that lack a formal "plus": that is, it blocks fire arrows, ice arrows and the like. The exceptions are the Arrows of Detonation, the Arrows  of Slaying, and the Arrows of Dispelling."

[spellstrike_vs_pm_scroll]
name="Allow Spellstrike to take down a Protection from Magic scroll"
description="In the original game, the protective sphere produced by a Protection from Magic scroll is completely impenetrable by any spell at all - if you use one, all a hostile wizard can do is run away or fight in melee. This component allows the most powerful mage anti-magic spell, the 9th level spell Spellstrike, to destroy the anti-magic sphere of one of these scrolls. It also allows the anti-magic ray of the Hive Mother beholder to destroy the sphere.</p>
  <p>If you are using the Icewind Dale spell system, Spellstrike and the Hive Mother ray can also destroy an Anti-Magic Shell."
SPELLSTRIKE="Spellstrike can remove the effects of the Protection from Magic scroll and (if you are using Icewind Dale's spell system) an Antimagic Shell."
  
[truesight_blindness]
name=Give True Sight the ability to prevent magical blindness
description="This spell modifies True Sight (and the clerical version, True Seeing) so that the caster is immune to Blindness while the spell is effective; existing Blindness effects
are also removed.</p>
<p>(The main reason for this change is that Blindness is essentially lethal for enemies (especially spellcasters). With this change, Truesight effectively works like Vocalize, in addition to its other effects.)"
CLERIC_TRUE_SIGHT,WIZARD_TRUE_SIGHT="Truesight removes the effect of Blindness."

[universal_trigger]
name=Make spell sequencers, spell triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages
description=In the unmodded game, spell sequencers, contingencies etc are in the Evocation school, making them unavailable to Enchanters; this is a serious weakness for the class. This component moves them to be in both the Conjuration and Evocation schools (like Wish), so that all mages may use them. The affected spells are Minor Sequencer, Spell Sequencer, Spell Trigger, Contingency, and Chain Contingency.
MINOR_SEQUENCER,SPELL_TRIGGER,SPELL_SEQUENCER,CONTINGENCY,CHAIN_CONTINGENCY=This spell's school has been changed to Conjuration/Evocation, so that all specialist mages can learn it.

[freedom_scrolls]
name=Make Freedom scrolls available earlier
description=Scrolls of Freedom (the spell that reverses Imprisonment) are fairly thin on the ground early in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>, whereas Liches love Imprisoning people. This component makes a few scrolls of Freedom available from Athkatlan stores (the Coppor Coronet and the Adventurer's Mart, in fact.)

[skull_trap]
name=Cap damage done by Skull Trap at <acronym title="12 rolls of a six-sided die">12d6</acronym>
description=Skull Trap, like the other Level 3 spells    Fireball and Lightning Bolt, does <acronym title="1 roll of a six-sided die">1d6</acronym> damage    per level. Unlike those spells, though (and, I suspect, via an oversight    on the developers' part, though I could be wrong) Skull Trap's damage is    not capped at <acronym title="10 rolls of a six-sided die">10d6</acronym>,    which makes it extremely lethal for a third level spell by the later part    of the game. This component caps the damage of Skull Trap at <acronym title="12 rolls of a six-sided die">12d6</acronym> (the    slightly higher cap reflects the much shorter range of Skull Trap compared    to Fireball.
SKULL_TRAP=Damage is capped at 12d6.

[clone_slots]
name=Prevent clones made by the Simulacrum and Project Image spells from using their magic items and innate abilities
description= present, clones can use magic items belonging to their creator - even one-shot items - as well as any class-based innate abilities, which arguably isn't what the spell is intended to do. This component blocks use of useable items and innate abilities, by greying out the quick-item bar and innate-ability bar for clones. Magic weapons, armour, and protective devices still function normally.
SIMULACRUM,PROJECT_IMAGE="Clones cannot use innate abilities or quick-slot magic items."

[sanctity_of_mind]
name=Enhance Impervious Sanctity of Mind
description=The Icewind Dale spell 'Impervious Sanctity of Mind' is seventh level but functionally identical to the BG2 spell Chaotic Commands (except it's self-only). This component enhances it to add a Spell Shield effect (first anti-magic spell absorbed harmlessly) and grant immunity to spell failure (though spells can still be disrupted by damage).</p>  <p>I will admit that this change, and the next, have an ulterior motive: I want to experiment with giving clerics more defensive magic. (At present, they can be killed off very quickly by a party.)
IMPERVIOUS_SANCTITY_OF_MIND=The spell also includes a Spell Shield effect (first anti-magic spell absorbed harmlessly) and grant immunity to spell failure (though spells can still be disrupted by damage).

[rebalance_lathander]
name=Rename and tweak Shield of Lathander
description=Shield of Lathander, an Icewind Dale spell, is a thematically awkward fit for Baldur's Gate, where clerics can have kits that dedicate them to specific gods. This component renames the spell to 'Divine Protection' and makes it usable by clerics of all alignments; it also restricts it to be self-only, since I think the third-party-target version is probably quite exploitable. Its casting time is also slightly shortened.
SHIELD_OF_LATHANDER=The spell has been renamed from 'Shield of Lathander' and is now usable by clerics of all alignments; it is self-only and has a shortened casting time.
GREATER_SHIELD_OF_LATHANDER=The spell has been renamed from 'Greater Shield of Lathander' and is now usable by clerics of all alignments; it is self-only and has a shortened casting time.

[circle_of_bones_duration]
name=Increase duration of Circle of Bones
description=The Icewind Dale spell 'Circle of Bones' (basically a low-level version of Blade Barrier) is thematically cool but very underpowered given its short (3-round) duration. This component increases the duration to one round per level, to a maximum of 20 rounds, and removes the immobilization effect.
CIRCLE_OF_BONES=The spell's duration is increased to 1 round per level and it no longer immobilizes the caster.

[enhance_thorn_spray]
name=Increase damage of Thorn Spray
description=The Icewind Dale spell 'Thorn Spray' is thematically cool but very underpowered given its low damage. This component increases the damage from 2d10 to 4d12, increasing to 5d12 at 9th level and to a maximum of 6d12 at 11th level.
THORN_SPRAY=Damage is increased from 2d10 to 4d12, increasing to 5d12 at 9th level and a maximum of 6d12 at 11th level.

[entropy_shield_abjuration]
name=Entropy Shield protects from abjurations
description=In IWD:EE (as of version 2.6), Entropy Shield has powerful, hidden protections: it makes the caster immune to Imprisonment, Spellstrike and Breach (the only spell that can take it down!)</p>  <p>This is pretty obviously a bug. None of these spells exist in vanilla IWD; there is no added documentation; what blocks them is that they all use the same projectile file (a green sparkling ball); that projectile is in just the right place to be accidently blocked by someone making an out-by-one error in editing the spell. The version of the spell shipped with SCS fixes the bug.</p>  <p>That said, it's actually quite an interesting thing to do to what's otherwise a somewhat underpowered spell, and usefully improves clerics' somewhat weak defenses, making NPC clerics more capable of surviving a few rounds. So we systematize it a bit, making it block spells of the Abjuration school, but not anti-spell attacks (and changing its type to SPELLPROTECTION, so that it can be removed by those spells).
  
[nerf_beetles]
name=Rebalance bombardier beetle cloud
description=In IWD, bombardier beetles have a gas cloud which has a 1/5 chance of stunning its target for 5 rounds (no save) and a 1/4 chance of deafening any non-stunned target for 7 rounds (again, no save). This is a pretty faithful conversion of the 2nd edition AD&D power, but while it's balanced about right for low-level play (where these creatures are encountered) it's excessively, and implausibly, powerful at higher levels.</p><p>This tweak grants a save vs. breath against both effects; as partial compensation, the probabilities increase, so that a creature is always targeted either by the stun or the deafness, with a 50% chance of each.

[rebalance_force_missiles]
name=Rebalance Mordenkainen's Force Missiles
description=Mordenkainen's Force Missiles, a 4th level spell, creates one missile plus one more per three levels above 7th, to a maximum of 7 missiles at 25th level; each missile does 2d4 damage (no save) and then does 1 point of damage per level of the caster (maximum 25) in a small area-of-effect, with a save to avoid. At 25th level, that's potentially 175+14d4 damage, which is pretty ridiculous for a 4th level spell. Put three of them into a sequencer, and now the damage is 525+42d4, which is ludicrous.</p> <p>This component caps the number of missiles at 4, and the area-of-effect damage per missile at 15. (And I'm still worried it's overpowered.)

[use_iwd_chromatic_orb]
name=Chromatic Orb has less drastic effects at high level, but no longer gives a +6 bonus to saving throws
CHROMATIC_ORB=The spell now works as in Icewind Dale: less drastic effects at higher levels, but no bonus to the saving throw.

[use_iwd_color_spray]
name=Color Spray now affects any creature of the caster's level or below
COLOR_SPRAY=The spell now affects any creature of the caster's level or below.

[use_iwd_blade_barrier_saving_throw]
name=A successful saving throw against Blade Barrier or Globe of Blades now reduces damage by half rather than negating it altogether
BLADE_BARRIER,GLOBE_OF_BLADES=A successful saving throw now reduces damage by half rather than negating it altogether.

[use_iwd_call_lightning]
name=The lightning bolts from Call Lightning now strike somewhat more frequently
CALL_LIGHTNING=The lightning bolts now strike somewhat more frequently

[use_iwd_defensive_harmony]
name=Defensive Harmony increases AC by +4 instead of +2
DEFENSIVE_HARMONY=The spell increases AC by +4 instead of +2

[use_iwd_lower_resistance]
name=Lower Resistance decreases resistance by 30% + 1%/level, not 10% + 1%/level
LOWER_RESISTANCE=Lower Resistance decreases resistance by 30% + 1%/level, not 10% + 1%/level

[use_iwd_magical_stone_damage]
name=Magical Stone does 3d4 damage (6d4 vs undead), rather than 1d4
MAGIC_STONE=Magical Stone does 3d4 damage (6d4 vs undead), rather than 1d4.

[use_iwd_protect_from_fire_duration]
name=The priest version of Protection from Fire now lasts for 1 turn per level rather than 3 rounds + 1 round per level
CLERIC_PROTECTION_FROM_FIRE=The spell now lasts for 1 turn per level rather than 3 rounds + 1 round per level.

[use_iwd_strength_of_one]
name=Strength of One increases recipients' strength to 18/76 rather than 18/75
STRENGTH_OF_ONE=Strength of One increases recipients' strength to 18/76 rather than 18/75.


[use_iwd_sols_searing_orb]
name=Sol's Searing Orb does 6d12 damage, not 3d6, and does not require a hit roll
SOL_SEARING_ORB=Sol's Searing Orb does 6d12 damage, not 3d6, and does not require a hit roll.

[use_iwd_shocking_grasp_targeting]
name=Shocking Grasp does not require a successful melee attack
SHOCKING_GRASP=The spell no longer requires a successful melee attack.

[use_iwd_slay_living_targeting]
name=Slay Living no longer requires a successful melee attack
SLAY_LIVING=The spell no longer requires a successful melee attack.

[use_iwd_strength_duration]
name=Strength has a duration of 1 hour per level rather than 1 turn per level
STRENGTH=The duration is increased to 1 hour per level.

[use_bg_flame_strike_damage]
name=Flame Strike does 1d8 damage per level, not a flat 8d6
FLAME_STRIKE=The spell does 1d8 damage per level, not a flat 8d6

[use_bg_flame_strike_targeting]
name=Flame Strike is now targeted on a creature rather than a point
FLAME_STRIKE=The spell is targeted on a creature rather than a point

[use_bg_ghost_armor]
name=Ghost Armor gives an AC of 2 (rather than 3) and lasts for 1 hour rather than 1 round per level
GHOST_ARMOR=The spell gives an AC of 2 (rather than 3) and lasts for 1 hour rather than 1 round per level.

[use_bg_holy_smite_unholy_blight]
name=Holy Smite and Unholy Blight now do 1d4 damage per level, rather than 1d6 per two levels with a cap at 5d6
HOLY_SMITE,UNHOLY_BLIGHT=The spell now does 1d4 damage per level, rather than 1d6 per two levels with a cap at 5d6.

[use_bg_spirit_armor_duration]
name=Spirit Armor lasts for 2 hours rather than 3 turns
SPIRIT_ARMOR=The spell lasts for 2 hours rather than 3 turns

[use_bg_ice_storm]
name=Ice Storm inflicts 2d8 cold damage per round for 4 rounds, rather than a one-off 3d10 damage
ICE_STORM=The spell inflicts 2d8 cold damage per round for 4 rounds, rather than a one-off 3d10 damage

[iwd_chant_does_not_prevent_casting]
name=Chant no longer prevents spellcasting (it does still reduce movement speed by 50%)
CHANT=The spell no longer prevents spellcasting

[use_hybrid_flame_blade]
name=Flame Blade does +1d4 fire damage, rather than +2
FLAME_BLADE=The spell now does +1d4 fire damage rather than +2

[restrict_abi_dalzim]
name=Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting does not affect undead, constructs, and (non-water) elementals
description=From its description, Horrid Wilting ought not to affect creatures with no moisture in their bodies. The actual spell, as implemented, affects basically everything (the IWD version does not affect undead). This component restricts the spell so as not to affect earth/air/fire elementals, undead, constructs and the like</p><p>Note that the 'Telekinetic Storm' spell, introduced by the New Arcane Spells component, does affect all these creatures, at the cost of doing slightly less damage (1d6 per level, not 1d8). This should help fill the tactical hole left by this component's restrictions.
ABI_DALZIMS_HORRID_WILTING=The spell no longer affects earth/air/fire elementals, undead, constructs, and the like.

[larloch]
name=Larloch's Minor Drain becomes more powerful at higher levels
description=The necromantic spell 'Larloch's Minor Drain' drains 1d4 hit points (in IWD) or 4 hit points (in BG/BG2) from the target and gives them to the caster. That's minor but not useless at first level, but it quickly becomes worthless at higher levels. This component makes the drain level-dependent: 1d4 at first level, increasing by 1d4 every two levels to a maximum of 5d4. That makes it roughly competitive with Magic Missile (the benefit that it heals the caster is offset against the slightly lower damage and the fact that it doesn't work on undead.)
LARLOCH_MINOR_DRAIN=The spell drains 1d4 hit points at 1st level, increasing by 1d4 every 2 levels to a maximum of 5d4.

[iron_body]
name=Modified version of the Iron Body spell (does not prevent spellcasting)
description=Iron Body (an 8th level wizard spell introduced in IWD) is thematically cool but in practice not that useful: it gives moderately nice defensive boosts but they're not that exciting, and it shuts down spellcasting, making it useless to single-class wizards in most circumstances. This component improves the physical damage protection (to 75%) and replaces the outright block on spellcasting with a -2 casting speed penalty. This should make the spell a fairly powerful defensive choice - but it is 8th level, so that seems apposite.
IRON_BODY=The physical damage protection increases to 75% and the spell now imposes a -2 casting time penalty rather than blocking spellcasting outright.

[energy_drain]
name=Energy Drain spell drains five levels rather than two
description=Energy Drain is a 9th-level spell with touch range that drains two levels from the target. That's not really competitive with other 9th-level options. This compnent increases the drain to 5 levels. It also applies to the 7th level priest spell of the same name, if you have it installed.
WIZARD_ENERGY_DRAIN,CLERIC_ENERGY_DRAIN=The spell drains 5 levels rather than 2.

[symbol_pain_no_save]
name=Symbol of Pain does not permit a saving throw
description=Symbol of Pain imposes a -4 penalty to attack rolls, -2 to Dexterity, and -2 to AC - but there is a saving throw to avoid it, making it uncompetitive with other Symbols like Death, Stun or Hopelessness, which actually take the target out of the battle if it fails its save. This component just removes the saving throw, making the Symbol a reliable weakening spell.
WIZARD_SYMBOL_PAIN,CLERIC_SYMBOL_PAIN=The spell no longer grants a saving throw.

[symbols_are_enchantment]
name=Move Symbols to the school of Enchantment
description=At higher levels, BG/IWD spells are very unequally divided across the spell schools - there are no enchantments at all above 5th level. This component addresses this by reallocating Symbols (Fear, Pain, Hopelessness, Stun, Death) to the Enchantment school.
WIZARD_SYMBOL_FEAR,CLERIC_SYMBOL_FEAR,WIZARD_SYMBOL_PAIN,CLERIC_SYMBOL_PAIN,WIZARD_SYMBOL_HOPELESSNESS,CLERIC_SYMBOL_HOPELESSNESS,WIZARD_SYMBOL_STUN,CLERIC_SYMBOL_STUN,WIZARD_SYMBOL_DEATH,CLERIC_SYMBOL_DEATH=The spell is moved to the Enchantment school.

[power_words_are_enchantment]
name=Move Power Words to the school of Enchantment
description=At higher levels, BG/IWD spells are very unequally divided across the spell schools - there are no enchantments at all above 5th level. This component addresses this by reallocating power words (Sleep, Silence, Stun, Blind, Kill) to the Enchantment school.
POWER_WORD_STUN,POWER_WORD_BLIND,POWER_WORD_KILL,POWER_WORD_SILENCE,POWER_WORD_SLEEP=The spell is moved to the Enchantment school.

[eldath_rename]
name=Rename 'Mist of Eldath' to 'Healing Mist'
description=This is a purely cosmetic change, intended to remove mismatches between an in-game character's faith and their memorized spells.
MIST_OF_ELDATH=This spell has been renamed from 'Mist of Eldath' to 'Healing Mist'.

[ilmater_rename]
name=Rename 'Favor of Ilmater' to 'Favor of the Martyr'
description=This is a purely cosmetic change, intended to remove mismatches between an in-game character's faith and their memorized spells.
FAVOR_OF_ILMATER=This spell has been renamed from 'Favor of Ilmater' to 'Favor of the Martyr'.


[adjust_monster_summoning]
name=Adjust Monster Summoning spells
description=In the unmodded game, summoned monsters from higher-level versions of Monster Summoning are of course more powerful, but the number summoned decreases. This tweak removes the number decrease, so that Monster Summoning spells always summon 2d3 monsters. The tweak also systematizes the levels of summoned monsters (which were already slightly higher than the spell descriptions suggest), with Monster Summoning VII summoning 11th-12th level creatures.</p><p>On BGEE or BG2EE, this tweak only applies if you are using the Icewind Dale arcane spells; on IWDEE, this tweak also standardizes Monster Summoning to summon humanoid monsters.</p>
MONSTER_SUMMONING_2: This spell now summons 2d3 3rd-level creatures.
MONSTER_SUMMONING_3: This spell now summons 2d3 4th-5th level creatures.
MONSTER_SUMMONING_4: This spell now summons 2d3 6th level creatures.
MONSTER_SUMMONING_5: This spell now summons 2d3 7th-8th level creatures.
MONSTER_SUMMONING_6: This spell now summons 2d3 9th-10th level creatures.
MONSTER_SUMMONING_7: This spell now summons 2d3 11th-12th level creatures.

[death_spell_summons]
name=Death Spell and Death Fog no longer automatically kill summoned monsters
description=This tweak removes the automatic killing of summoned creatures from Death Fog and Death Spell, following Icewind Dale's model. Note that since Death Spell kills any creature of 8th level or below without a saving throw, the great majority of summons will still be killed by the spell. The swords summoned by Mordenkainen's Sword and the bears summoned by Conjure Animals have been slightly adjusted so as to be low enough level to be killed by Death Spell.
DEATH_SPELL,DEATH_FOG=The spell no longer automatically kills summoned monsters.


[death_spell_summons_iwd]
name=Summoned creatures from Mordenkainen's Sword and Conjure Animals are now low enough level that they will be killed by Death Spell (which, in IWD, does not automatically slay summoned monsters).

[elemental_summoning]
name=Remove the battle for control from arcane elemental summoning spells
description=The fifth- and sixth-level Conjure Elemental spells on the mage spell list require a three-round mental battle to control the elemental. This in practice makes the spell mostly useless (three rounds is far too long to stand around in combat; players could cast it in advance, but the AI can't) and in any case very underpowered. This component just makes the summoned elemental directly under the player's control.
CONJURE_FIRE_ELEMENTAL,CONJURE_AIR_ELEMENTAL,CONJURE_EARTH_ELEMENTAL,CONJURE_LESSER_AIR_ELEMENTAL,CONJURE_LESSER_EARTH_ELEMENTAL,CONJURE_LESSER_FIRE_ELEMENTAL=The spell no longer requires a battle to control the elemental: it is automatically controlled by the caster.

[restoration_ability_drain]
name=Restoration spells restore ability drain
description=The Lesser Restoration and Restoration spells (and any items or abilities that duplicate their effects) now restore lost ability score points, e.g. from the Ray of Enfeeblement spell or the Devour Brain ability of the mind flayer. (The spell does not restore permanently lost ability score points.)
LESSER_RESTORATION,RESTORATION=Temporarily lost ability score points are now restored.

[revise_polymorph]
name=Revised version of Polymorph Self
description=This component revises the forms available from the fourth level wizard spell 'Polymorph Self' (which, in my judgement, are generally a bit underpowered). The ogre and flind forms are removed (the flind form included an implausible magical weapon). The druid-equivalent forms (wolf, brown bear, black bear) are also removed, to keep thematic distance from druid shapeshifting. The mustard jelly form is unchanged; the spider form is unchanged except for a minor web-spinning power.</p><p>Four new forms are introduced:<ul><li>Hill Giant Barbarian (powerful attacks, Barbarian Rage)</li><li>Ogre Mage (reasonably strong attacks, permits spellcasting)</li><li>Hell Hound (immunity to fire, fiery breath attack)</li><li>Rat (good Armor Class, can become invisible when not in combat)</li></ul></p><p>Full documentation on the available forms can be found <a href="../subdocuments_dw/polymorph_desc.html">here</a>.</p><p>In addition, Polymorph Self now allows you to choose your first form when you cast the spell, instead of having to wait until the next round.
POLYMORPH_SELF=Available forms are changed; full details <a href="polymorph_desc.html">here</a>.

[revise_shapechange]
name=Revised version of Shapechange
description=This component revises the forms available from the ninth level wizard spell 'Shapechange' (which, in my judgement, are generally a bit underpowered). The werewolf and elemental forms are removed, to keep thematic distance from druid shapeshifting. The mind flayer form gains some physical damage resistance, can use Psionic Blast at will, and permits spellcasting. The iron golem form gains a poison-gas breath weapon. The giant troll form has significantly improved regeneration (30 hp/rd) and permits spellcasting.</p><p>Three new forms are introduced:<ul><li>Marilith Demon (many attacks, strong resistances, permits spellcasting, teleport at will)</li><li>Greater Basilisk (petrifying gaze, poisonous claws)</li><li>Invisible Stalker (becomes improved invisible automatically once per round, permits spellcasting)</li></ul>Full documentation on the available forms can be found <a href="../subdocuments_dw/shapechange_desc.html">here</a>.</p><p>In addition, Shapechange now allows you to choose your first form when you cast the spell, instead of having to wait until the next round.</p>
SHAPECHANGE=Available forms are changed; full details <a href="shapechange_desc.html">here</a>.

[enhance_cure_cause]
name=Increase the power of Cure Wounds and Cause wounds spells
description=The Cure and Cause Wounds families are very weak, especially at higher levels - it really isn't worth (e.g.) using a fourth-level cleric slot to heal 14 hit points or do the same amount of damage. This component increases the effectiveness of these spells somewhat (roughly following 3rd edition D&D): they heal (or cause) 5 hit points per level of the spell, plus a bonus amount equal to 1 per level of the caster but no more than 5 per level of the spell (so a maximum of 5 for Cure Light Wounds, but 20 for Cure Serious Wounds). For lore reasons, this is capped at 20th level on Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II. (The exact amount of enhancement can be customized; see the main readme.)
CURE_LIGHT_WOUNDS=The spell now heals 5 hit points, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 5.
CURE_MODERATE_WOUNDS=The spell now heals 10 hit points, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 10.
CURE_MEDIUM_WOUNDS=The spell now heals 15 hit points, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 15.
CURE_SERIOUS_WOUNDS=The spell now heals 20 hit points, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 20.
CURE_CRITICAL_WOUNDS=The spell now heals 25 hit points, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 20 (25 in Icewind Dale).
CAUSE_LIGHT_WOUNDS=The spell now does 5 hit points damage, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 5.
CAUSE_MODERATE_WOUNDS=The spell now does 10 hit points damage, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 10.
CAUSE_MEDIUM_WOUNDS=The spell now does 15 hit points damage, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 15.
CAUSE_SERIOUS_WOUNDS=The spell now does 20 hit points damage, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 20.
CAUSE_CRITICAL_WOUNDS=The spell now does 25 hit points damage, plus 1 per level to a maximum of 20 (25 in Icewind Dale).

[lightning_bolt_damage]
name=Rebounding lightning bolts only inflict damage once
description=This component alters Lightning Bolt (and similar spells) so that any creature takes damage from the lightning bolt only once, however often it rebounds into them.
LIGHTNING_BOLT=Any creature is only damaged once by each Lightning Bolt, no matter how often it rebounds into them.

[remove_antimagic_shell]
name=Remove the Antimagic Shell spell
description=The Antimagic Shell spell is removed entirely, on the grounds that it's an awkward fit to the BG2 antimagic system
ANTIMAGIC_SHELL=This spell has been removed entirely.

[mordenkainens_force_blade_thac0]
name=Increase the accuracy of Mordenkainen's Force Blade
description=Mordenkainen's Force Blade (the IWD version of Mordenkainen's Sword) attacks as a fighter of half the level as the caster, which is not really competitive at the level at which it is cast. This component shifts it to attack as a fighter of the same level as the caster.
MORDENKAINENS_SWORD_IWD=The force blade is used as a Fighter of the caster's level (instead of half their level).

[haste_cancels_slow]
name=Haste and Slow effects cancel; slow always gives AC and THAC0 penalties
description=The Haste and Slow effects cancel each other out; also, Slow effects always give a -4 penalty to AC and THAC0. (This was true for the Slow spell itself but not for many other spells and items.)
HASTE=Haste is cancelled by Slow.
IMPROVED_HASTE=Haste is cancelled by Slow.
SLOW=Slow is cancelled by Haste.

[otiluke_save_for_half]
name=Otiluke's Freezing Sphere does half damage on a successful save
description=This component causes the Freezing Sphere spell to do half damage if the target saves vs. spells, rather than completely dodging the sphere.
OTILUKES_FREEZING_SPHERE=The sphere does half damage (rather than no damage) on a successful save.

[glyph_save_for_half]
name=Glyph of Warding does half damage on a successful save
description=This component causes a Glyph of Warding to do half damage if the target saves vs. spells, rather than completely avoiding damage.
GLYPH_OF_WARDING=The glyph does half damage (rather than no damage) on a successful save.
