Level: 1
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By using this spell, the priest can temporarily enchant a small pebble, which is then hurled or slung at an opponent.

Level: 3
Sphere: Weather
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level, up to 11 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Visual range of the caster
Saving Throw: 1/2

A Call Lightning spell must be cast outside; otherwise, it will not work and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to call down 1 bolt per round per caster level (capped at 11 bolts). Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points per level of the caster. Thus, a 5th-level caster calls down five 7d8 bolts (2d8 + 5d8). The caster only chooses the first target of the spell, but subsequent bolts will only strike <PRO_HISHER> enemies."

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell forces the target to Save vs. Death or be instantly killed. If the Saving Throw is successful, the target takes 2d6+9 points of magic damage instead. Note that a character struck with a Slay Living spell can still be raised from the dead with a Raise Dead or Resurrection spell."

@7="Blade Barrier
(Evocation)

Level: 6
Sphere: Guardian, Creation
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

The priest employs this spell to set up a wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around the caster, creating an impenetrable barrier.

Saving Throw: Special

This spell allows the caster to hurl a brilliant, searing flash at a target. When it hits, it explodes in a flash of light, doing 6d12 points of fire damage to the target and blinding <PRO_HIMHER> for 3 rounds if a Save vs. Spell is failed. If the Saving Throw is made, the target only takes half damage and is not blinded. Undead creatures are particularly vulnerable to this spell, taking double damage."

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 29-ft. cone with 90-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from the caster's hand. Creatures within the area are affected in order of increasing distance from the wizard. All creatures in the area above the level of the caster or ones that have greater than 6 Hit Dice must make a Save vs. Spell. The spell's effects depend on the caster—creatures with Hit Dice/levels fewer than or equal to the caster are knocked unconscious (do not awaken when struck) for 5 rounds, those with Hit Dice/levels one or two greater than the wizard are blinded for 3 rounds, and any other creatures are stunned for 1 round.

Blind creatures are unaffected by the color spray."

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a 4-inch-diameter sphere that can be hurled unerringly to its target. The orb's effects depend on the level of the wizard:

– 1: Inflicts 1d4 magic damage and blinds the target for one round.
– 2: Inflicts 1d6 fire damage and inflicts pain upon the victim (-1 penalty to Armor Class and THAC0) for one round.
– 3: Inflicts 1d8 magic damage and burns the victim for 1d3 fire damage.
– 4: Inflicts 1d10 magic damage and blinds the target for 4 rounds.
– 5 to 6: Inflicts 1d12 magic damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds.
– 7 and up: Inflicts 2d8 magic damage and paralyzes the victim for 13 rounds.

There is no saving throw against the damage, but a successful Save vs. Spell negates all other effects."

Level: 2
Sphere: Elemental Fire

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from <PRO_HISHER> hand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it were a scimitar (i.e. it uses the Scimitar proficiency). If the caster successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1d4 points of slashing damage plus 4 points of fire damage, with a further 2 fire damage if the creature is undead. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it."

This spell creates a magical field of force with the strength of plate armor (AC 2). It is cumulative with Dexterity effects and, in the case of Fighter/Mages, with the shield bonus.

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is placed upon a poisoned individual, it slows the effects of venom. This spell does not neutralize the poison; instead, it just slows it down enough for the recipient to get real healing at a temple or from <PRO_HISHER> party's priest, or for the poison to naturally fade from the recipient's system.

This spell also cures intoxication."

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to <PRO_HISHER> own. The target creature suffers 1d4 magic damage, while the wizard gains 1d4 Hit Points. This increases by 1d4 per two levels above first level, to a maximum of 5d4 at 9th level.

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting <PRO_HIMHER> several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster is 100% resistant to electricity and poison, 50% resistant to fire and acid, and 75% resistant to physical damage (though the latter cannot be further improved by other effects). Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored. In addition, the caster's Strength is raised to 25, and the caster can attack twice per round with iron fists for 2d4 points of damage plus appropriate Strength bonuses.

Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting <PRO_HISHER> movement rate to 25% of <PRO_HISHER> normal, and <PRO_HISHER> spellcasting becomes more sluggish, imposing a -2 penalty on casting times. The spell ends immediately if the caster is affected by any kind of polymorph effect."

Level: 5

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, a mass of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm, first attacking the target, and then moving on to all enemies of the caster within the spell's radius. Invisibility is no protection.

For the duration of the spell, those affected suffer one point of piercing damage per second and fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round, the victim must save vs. breath weapons at -2 or suffer a 100% chance of spell failure, and must save vs. spells at -2 or run in panic. Creatures protected from the damage, such as by the Stoneskin spell, are unaffected by these secondary effects as long as their protection lasts.

The insects summoned by the spell are not themselves magical creatures. This means that they are not repelled by magical protections such as antimagic; equally, their bites and stings are nonmagical and cannot harm creatures that require magical weapons to injure them. The insects will shun the unnatural flesh of the undead, and cannot penetrate barriers of extreme cold or heat like those created by the Fire Shield spell. Lastly, the Death Spell will destroy all hostile insects in its area of effect.~

For the duration of the spell, those affected suffer two points of piercing damage per second and fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round, the victim must save vs. breath weapons at -2 or suffer a 100% chance of spell failure, and must save vs. spells at -2 or run in panic.

The Summon Insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack one enemy of the caster. This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range and attacks any single creature the caster points to. The victim may make a Saving Throw vs. Breath Weapon with a -4 penalty to escape the swarm; otherwise, the victim receives 1 point of piercing damage every 2 seconds for the duration of the spell. Moreover, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> attack roll and a -2 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class. The swarm will repeatedly bite the target, making it very difficult to cast spells (50% chance of spell failure, with a saving throw vs. breath weapons each round to avoid for that round). Creatures protected from the damage, such as by the Stoneskin spell, are unaffected by these secondary effects as long as their protection lasts.

Secondly, the caster's concentration is enhanced, so that <PRO_HESHE> has no chance of casting failure from effects like Miscast Magic (<PRO_HISHER> spells can still be disrupted by damage).

The wizard creates one missile at 7th level and an additional missile at every third level after 7th, to a maximum of four missiles — in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, and four at 16th. Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 5-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 15 points — for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of magic damage. Creatures taking damage can attempt a Save vs. Spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no Saving Throw. The 1st-level wizard spell Shield will absorb the force missiles harmlessly, including the concussion damage."

The thorn spray covers a 17-ft.-long cone, inflicting 4d12 points of piercing damage to all creatures within the area of effect. The damage increases to 5d12 at 9th level and to a maximum of 6d12 at 11th level. A successful Saving Throw vs. Death halves the damage."

Thus, <PRO_HESHE> can change into a mind flayer to stun <PRO_HISHER> opponents and then become an iron golem to crush <PRO_HISHER> foes. These creatures have whatever Hit Points the wizard had at the time of the shapechange. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.

The caster may choose between these six forms:
 – Iron Golem: immune to most magic and elemental damage, powerful crushing attacks, Gas Cloud once per 3 rounds
 – Mind Flayer: 90% magic resistance, 50% physical damage resistance, intelligence-drain attack, Psionic Blast once per round
 – Giant Troll: regenerates 5 hp per second, powerful piercing attacks
 – Marilith: 5 attacks per round, 85% magic resistance, immune to electrical and fire damage, 50% cold resistance, Teleport Without Error once per round
 – Greater Basilisk: Petrifying Gaze once per round, powerful poisonous attacks
 – Invisible Stalker: 30% magic resistance, fairly powerful crushing attacks, becomes improved-invisible automatically once per round

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of several creatures. For the duration of the spell, the caster can transform into any of the new forms at any time and as many times as <PRO_HESHE> wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others. The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, but all physical attributes are obtained from the new form. Also, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistance to missile and crushing weapons possessed by the slime form.

The possible forms given by Polymorph Self are:
 – Hill Giant Barbarian: powerful piercing attacks, Barbarian Rage once per day
 – Ogre Mage: powerful slashing attacks, can cast spells in this form
 – Mustard Jelly: capable of poisoning or slowing opponents
 – Spider: powerful poisonous attacks, Web Tangle once per 2 rounds
 – Hell Hound: immune to fire, Hell Hound Fiery Breath once per 3 rounds
 – Rat: difficult to hit, Hide once per round"
